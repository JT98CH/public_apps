Joshua Weissman,Making Movie Theater Popcorn At Home | But Better,2021-06-20 14:00:11,"Is it possible to make popcorn better than the movie theaters already do? Well.... I think so, maybe... First, we'll make the greatest homemade buttered popcorn recipe as the main portion, but just to add onto that I'll show you two other special ways. By special I mean garlic bread flavored popcorn, and a perfect salted caramel corn that's so good you'll want to sneak your own popcorn into the theater.

Joshua Weissman,The Ultimate Guide to Picking The Perfect Kitchen Knife,2019-09-22 19:21:00,"Whether you're a beginner or advanced you'll have a good idea of what kitchen knife you need after watching this. A lot of people don't know what to look for when picking a kitchen knife or chef knife. People ask me ""what chef knife should I get?"" or ""what kind of kitchen knife should I get?"" and the answer is simple but requires some elaboration. That's why I met up with Josh Donald at Bernal Cutlery to get you all the answers.

This is that bun, but better, and really easy to make. This is a combination between a brioche and Japanese milk bread dough, that to me creates the ultimate burger bun. It's light and airy, glossy, and has a nice fluffy inside that gets a great toast and absorbs juices without going soggy. Plus these buns can be used for all sorts of things other than burgers, like the most amazing breakfast sandwich, or a fried chicken sandwich. It's all good, and just in time for that summer grilling.

I used a Japanese Milk bread dough (also known as hokkaido milk bread) with a tangzhong to make these beautiful bread rolls. Oh, and they're brushed with garlic butter so that helps too. Best part is that these are way easier to do than you think. You can totally start these earlier in the day and then have them ready by dinner. Or you can just make them because they're so incredible.

Cuts of Steak I recommend:
Ribeye (my favorite)
Sirloin
Strip (also known as new york strip)
T-Bone or Porterhouse (be aware that you have two diff cuts on this which means it's going to cook at diff degrees on both sides)

Ingredients you'll need:
1-2 large steak that is 1.5-2 inches thick (You can also do two steaks at a time per pan if you wish if your pan accommodates two without overcrowding the pan)
Kosher Salt to taste
Black Pepper to taste
2-4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed left in the skin
1 bunch of fresh thyme
4 tablespoons (56g) unsalted butter

Temperatures To pull your steak out of the pan:
Rare: 125F (52C)
Medium Rare: 135F (57C)
Medium 145F (63C) *wait what are you...*
Medium Well 150F (66C) *wait.. stop*
Well Done 160F (71c) *oh.*

It's all about the technique. You can make two completely different kinds of stock with almost the exact same ingredients and yet have them be totally different in flavor and appearance. Hence, white stock and brown stock. This guide is going to talk all about that, and I also decided to throw in a little bit on how to cut up a chicken and totally debone it's thigh! So, let's all start making homemade chicken stock more often, and let's start that here.

Joshua Weissman,How to Steam Your Home Oven For Perfect Bread,2018-12-22 15:30:02,"In case you didn't know, in order to bake beautiful sourdough breads properly you absolutely must have steam. There is no question about it. Steam is what moisturizes the outside of the loaf and allows it to form a malleable skin that expands during baking, otherwise you would just have a brick rather than a light airy loaf. Now the means in which you go about obtaining that steam can be done a few different ways. The more common way for home bakers is to use the dutch oven or cast iron pot method which basically just traps the steam the loaf itself puts out. The oven steaming method is superior and in this video I'll show you why.

Here's the process in steps: 
1.Preheat your stones with the lava rocks to 505F or 262C for 1 hour
2. 15 minutes before loading your oven pour boiling water over 4 rolled up towels placed in a metal baking dish (don't use glass) and place on the floor of your oven next to the lava rocks. 
3. 5 minutes before loading your oven(which would be 10 minutes into placing your towels in), turn your broiler on high to superheat the stone. 
4. After that time is up, turn your broiler off and set the oven back to 505F or 262C.
5. Place your loaves on individual sheets of parchment paper, score them as you like, spray them lightly with water.
6. Load your oven with your loaves making sure there is room for expansion 
7. Lay a kitchen towel on the glass part of your oven door to prevent shattering (DO NOT SKIP), then using oven mitts slightly pull out your lava rock skillet, pour in 2 cups or 473ml of water (room temperature or cold water is fine) and very quickly but safely close the oven door to trap the steam. 
8. Steam for 20 minutes, then remove both steamers, reduce the oven temperature down to 465F or 240C and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes or until rich dark brown.",PT5M54S,Have tags,447182,10259,508,0,5.9,saturday,2018,12,22,0.024077444977660102,0

Joshua Weissman,3 Ingredient Homemade Fermented Ginger Beer,2018-12-08 15:15:01,"Look fermentation is cool. That's just how it is. This drink is an almost miraculous moment, where you literally just take some sugar, and some ginger, mix it in water, let it sit, and then in a few days, you have a powerful fermented mixture to make your very own ginger beer without adding any commercial yeast at all. You are basically harnessing the power of nature to make a Moscow Mule. So yeah, that's pretty cool.

Ingredients you'll need:
Large Batch of Dry Cure-
2 cups (400g) kosher salt
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
6.5 teaspoons (60g) pink curing salt (NOT himalayan pink salt. The link to the curing salt that I use is closer to the top of the description here.) 

Curing the Belly:
at least a 3 pound (1360g)  or more, skin on pork belly

*The most accurate way of curing (my preferred method):*
Cure the pork belly at a 2.5 percent cure. Multiply the weight of your pork belly in grams by .025 and the number you get from that will be the amount of dry cure that you need to use on the bacon. So in other words a 1600g pork belly would require 40g of dry cure.

*The non gram scale version of curing:*
Basically sprinkle a generous layer of cure on a baking sheet (about 1/3 of a cup) and dredge your pork belly in it to thoroughly coat all sides. Less accurate, could result in slightly salty bacon, but it works in a pinch if you don't have a scale and don't plan on getting one.",PT6M55S,Have tags,1894579,39448,1535,0,6.916666666666667,saturday,2018,10,20,0.021631718709011344,0

Of course I also included how to make chashu, and nice jammy soft boiled eggs. I was originally going to upload those as individual videos, but then decided to just have every component made in this video. From what I've heard, a lot of ramen shops will actually boil their bones for over 14-24 hours, but this recipe still makes a beautiful broth just at 12 hours.

Joshua Weissman,How To Achieve Sourdough Starter Mastery,2018-08-18 16:00:00,"I've been getting a lot of questions after releasing my Ultimate Sourdough Starter Guide, so I decided to make a relatively thorough sourdough starter maintenance guide. First, because I wanted to answer those questions, and second because I wanted to get some other information out that I didn't get in that video. I hope this will help teach you not only how to make a sourdough starter but how to make it super bubbly and powerful!

I'm just giving you the option and ability to take your knife from dull to sharper than a razor using a whetstone. ;) Also *DISCLAIMER*: This technique is something that I learned as a beginner while working in restaurants. It was really only intended to get newbies started on the idea of using a whetstone. This video is NOT intended to be a professional all inclusive knife video. It's simply supposed to be a fun/entertaining video to get people interested in learning about knife sharpening. I suggest doing your own research and finding your own way to sharpen a knife after getting started off this guide!

There is a sample Bread schedule at the bottom of this description as well as links to my favorite items on Amazon* I've gotten tons of questions from you guys asking for a guide on my bread. This is a more simplified and less complicated (believe it or not) version. With that said, I know this is still something that seems pretty time consuming, but you have to remember that the majority of the time is completely inactive, so it's really not. It just requires a little patience. You know what though? That's what bread is all about. Bread is such a meditational process to me. You're not worrying about your job, you're not stressing about finances, you're just completely focused on one thing. The bread. Hope you guys at least give it the chance to try it!

Joshua Weissman,Crazy Easy Tomato and Olive Focaccia + A Thank you,2018-06-22 15:30:01,"Focaccia is the kind of recipe that has a lot of room for error (as far as recipes go at least). It shouldn't be fussy or stressful to make. It's as easy as throwing some water, salt, and yeast into a stand mixer, mixing it, waiting for a little bit, topping it, and baking it. Very hands off, and super simple. More importantly, this is the kind of bread that people want to eat all the time. It's crispy on the outside but soft and tender on the outside; saturated with fragrant olive oil and bursts of tomato and olive flavor. I mean, yeah.... you get it.

Joshua Weissman,Insanely Crispy Japanese Fried Chicken (Chicken Kaarage),2018-04-13 17:00:02,"I'm sure we are all very familiar with fried chicken at some level. Now Japanese fried chicken is similar but also very different. It's a completely gluten free fried chicken since it's traditionally fried using corn starch as the dredge for the chicken. It has a thin and ultra crispy crust with intensely flavored marinated chicken underneath and is traditionally served with a mayonnaise or aioli for dipping. INSANELY good and INSANELY easy to make.

No store-bought or fast food chain will ever be able to stand up against these incredibly flakey and buttery homemade biscuits. The cool thing about these beautiful little quick breads is that they are exactly that; quick. You can make these so fast and easily, and yet the final product looks and tastes like hours of work. Make these any day of the week for any purpose, but they go best with a group of people. Breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, you name it. Plus Easter is coming up... you're family and friends will thank you if you make this for them. You read the title...they're flakey af.

The moment that I saw these cookies take the internet by storm, I jumped on the cookie bandwagon and tried them out. Lucky for you, Alison let me share the recipe with you!  One of the many beautys of these cookies, is that they are the perfect ""make-ahead"" cookie of all time. Make the dough, roll it up, and either refrigerate it a few days ahead of baking time, or freeze it for up to a month. All you have to do is pull them out of the fridge, slice them, and bake them. Hope you guys enjoy this one!

Let me know what other types of recipes and videos you'd like to see from me!

Also, for the record I would like to add that I typically love the sous vide method but not for this application. I will likely do another video in the future that emphasizes just the sous vide method. I really think there is a lot of versatility there.

Not many things impress me anymore with steaks and beef. I love dry ageing so much that I do it quite often. But when I heard about water ageing I was very skeptical but gave it a try anyway. I am so glad I did as I was not expecting of what happened to happen.

My thoughts were that it would prevent the steak from going bad but at the same time develop amazing flavor that has never been done before. So I pushed the limits and dry aged it for 1yr.

Guga Foods,I dry-aged steaks in BLACK GARLIC ate it and this happened!,2023-08-27 14:15:02,"There is something quite special about garlic, it's used in most cuisines.  It's delicious and it makes most foods taste better. However there is also black garlic.  This is known to be even better. Today I do an insane experiment to see if it will make my steaks taste better.

Guga Foods,Steak TENDERIZING Experiment!,2023-07-19 14:15:02,"Check out Chef iQ smart meat thermometer https://pixelfy.me/ZOhaao Thanks Chef iQ for sponsoring this video.

Not many ingredients have changed the way I cook steaks. However after today's ginger experiment everything has changed.  As you know ginger tastes amazing with steaks. But what I didn't know was that it can also tenderize steaks. Does it really work? Let's find out.

Guga Foods,I went to JAPAN to find their most PRIZED Wagyu!,2023-07-02 14:15:00,"While I love a classic wiener, when I want a 100% single source option, I always go for Oscar Mayer’s 100% beef franks. Check out Oscar Mayer here: https://bit.ly/43DGcXH

I went all the way to Japan to find the unseen, undiscovered and most prized wagyu no one has ever heard of before.  It's called mother wagyu.  By far one of the best experience of my life.

There is a lot to learn from it. But most importantly it's one of the experiment that I need to learn more.

If you know MSG you know it's one of the most amazing seasoning to use on many things, but at the same time it does have a bad reputation. Today I share with you a new seasoning I been working on that makes things taste better than MSG! It's all natural and you can make it home.

Never thought deep frying chicken in different fats would make such a huge difference. Wagyu, Duck and pork fats (lard), expensive or cheap, which one is the winner of this challenge? I am so pleased I ran this experiment. Learning new things is the only way to get better. This cook was a huge success.

Honey is amazing to eat and in recipes, but it is also fantastic for many other things. I learned so much about honey with this experiment and today I share everything with you.  Dry Age steaks in honey is something I never thought I would do but the results are in. This cook is one of the most interesting ones. Is it better than wagyu? Let's test it and you be the judge!

Guga Foods,"I cooked every MEAT in the CHEAPEST Grill I found, it blew my mind!",2020-05-27 13:15:00,"Finding the cheapest grill out there that can cook every meat was not easy. But I was able to make it happen. This grill is so cheap that by the end of this video I was so surprised that it lasted for every cook. There is no excuse to make wonderful perfectly cooked meat. You just need to know how and on this video I show you all I know.

If you have never had Street Corn you should! You can do this while you#stayhome but this is not regular corn, the wide range of flavors and spices used in this recipe will have you feeling like a million dollars. To pair up this wonderful elote I cooked a nice skirt steak (aka churrasco) with a unique marinade that will have you wanting more. Cook #WithMe this wonderful street corn and steak but #AtHome.

Guga Foods,Will PINEAPPLE Completely DISINTEGRATE a STEAK? | Guga Foods,2019-09-04 13:15:00,"Pineapple have enzymes that cut down proteins, they are called Bromelain. It is known that you can tenderize meat with this enzyme. Today I am pushing the limit to find out how much is too much. This experiment is for 4 steaks cut out of the same loin. They all have been exposed to the pineapple for 1hr, 6hrs, 16hrs and 24hrs. How much is too much?

Guga Foods,Unlocking CRISPY PORK BELLY Secrets | Guga Foods,2019-08-21 13:15:01,"Crunchy and crispy pork belly is tricky to achieve. By testing 4 different ways I finally unlocked the secret of making the perfect pork belly. Poring hot oil, using a dehydrator and making the Chinese version of pork belly are one of the ways I tested on this video. Now you can achieve the same success at home by following your preferred crunchiness.

After visiting Philadelphia I was inspired to make the best philly cheesesteak I could! Once I arrived from Philly I was able to make a better cheese steak after watching the masters Pat's and Geno's at work. I used simple ingredients, made it simple and it turned out the best ever.

Guga Foods,60 Days DRY-AGED BRISKET Experiment | GugaFoods,2018-12-19 16:30:00,"Brisket is the passion of everyone that loves BBQ. That is a FACT. So, I decided to combine 2 things I love most about American BBQ, low and slow and Dry Age and see what would happen with this brisket. I dry aged it for a total of 60 days to see what would happen.  The results are so surprising that I am still in shock of what actually happen.  I am bringing this to the comments down below.

Steps on HOW TO SMOKE BRISKET LOW AND SLOW
- I cooked it for @ (250°F / 121°C) until point temp reached 150°F / 65°C

- Then I used the Texas crunch technique until point temp reached 185°F / 85°C (I usually take it out at 205F°F however it was probe tender at 185°F so it was time to take it out)

- Let it rest for 2 hours in a cooler wrapped on the foil and a towel to keep it warm.

Guga Foods,Standing RIB ROAST Hot & Fast Grilled on BBQ - Prime Rib Roast,2018-09-19 15:45:02,"This amazing Standing Rib Roast (aka Prime Rib) was cooked hot and fast. Normally you want to cook your rib roast low and slow, but when you don't have the time this is a great alternative method to use.  The big issue with this method is that it will not produce that edge to edge medium rare like sous vide or reverse sear.  So you are trading time for edge to edge perfection.

Guga Foods,Japanese Wagyu Beef FRIED RICE! A5 Kobe Beef,2018-08-08 15:45:00,"Japanese wagyu is the best beef in the world. When cooking it one of the best things about it is the fat, which renders down and never gets used. So for today's cook I am using 100% of this expensive kobe beef and making the most expensive and delicious fried rice in the world.

Guga Foods,Is this the BEST WAY to GRILL a STEAK? What!? The HANDHELD BROILER method.,2018-04-11 16:00:06,"On of my subscribers suggested I try the hand held broiler technique! After him describing this method and me doing my research which I believe Alton Brown was the first one that created this technique. I decided to give it a try. I was very happy I did!  I used a whole 5 bones rib roast and I butcher the whole thing showing how to cut cowboy steaks out of it. After Frenching the bones from the bone-in ribeye roast I ended up with 5 beautiful 2.5"" thick steaks. But one was 3"" thick! That is the steak I used for this experiment.

Guga Foods,Brazilian CHEESY BREAD Recipe - aka Pão De Queijo - Easy Cheese Bread,2018-03-21 16:00:01,"From my hometown in Brazil, Uberaba, Minas Gerais I bring to you guys the world famous Pão De Queijo, aka Brazilian Cheese Bread.  This is made in every Brazilian Churrascaria.  It is easy and simple to make. You can also freeze them, it will last up to 6 months in the freezer is really an amazing recipe.

HOW TO BAKE BRAZILIAN CHEESE BREAD
I cooked it for 30mins @ (325°F / 163°C)
Or until lightly Golden Brown

* INGREDIENTS *  I used for cheese bread recipe.
5 Cups of Tapioca Starch: http://amzn.to/2pf5URv
2 Eggs 
2 cups of Whole Milk 
1/2 cup Vegetable Oil 
2 tbsp Fine Salt (I like mine with 2 tbsp fine salt if you like less salty use 1 tbsp) Be exact on your tbsp use a measuring method don't guess with salt!
2 cups Mozzarella Cheese 
1 cups Parmesan Cheese (4oz)

* IMPORTANT NOTES WATCH VIDEO BELOW * 
Tips & Tricks for perfection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCa7DxS0WT0

* PS. First Watch the video above. On video I showed only 3 cups of Tapioca Starch but I used 5, you can use 4 and add all the wet stuff, mix everything and add more accordingly. If you put less tapioca starch it will be a moist and gooey inside.  If you add more it will be dryer and more towards bread style. I recommend starting with 5 cups and adjust to your liking.

Nick DiGiovanni,World's Largest Sushi (Official World Record),2022-10-29 16:00:35,"I'm choosing THREE random subscribers to be part of our 10 million subscriber Guinness World Record video. Subscribe and hit the bell icon and YOU can win a world record with me!! You can live anywhere in the world to win and your name could be on the record. 

Today's sushi roll was 3,000 LBS! That's 45,000 standard sushi rolls, all in one. This marks our fifth official Guinness World Records title, but, more importantly, ALL of this food was safely donated to a homeless shelter in Boston with the help of The Farmlink Project. I also want to give a huge thanks to our health inspector Dennis, who monitored the food and ensured we wore proper protective gear to make sure the food was safe to donate. 

A huge thanks to our entire team for making this happen. It was certainly our biggest video yet. I'd also like to thank the amazing teams at Love Art Sushi (https://loveartsushi.com) and John Nagle Co. (https://johnnagle.com).

Of all places, plane food is often quite bad. But, can it be good? Emirates has an in-flight menu where, if flying first class, you can order as much food as you want throughout the entire flight. Their menu ranges from expensive caviar to top-shelf champagnes. Join me for the ride (and dining experience) of a lifetime!

Nick DiGiovanni,Cooking Fried Chicken In The Drive Thru,2022-04-09 16:00:00,"""Can I order a fried chicken sandwich without the chicken?"" Such an order can be rather confusing for most fast-food employees. But once we turn the corner and they see the deep frying setup in our car, it all makes sense. 

As a tip, if you are making fried chicken, be sure to brine in buttermilk and pickle juice for extra flavor. Then, be sure to use some potato starch when frying. Happy cooking!

To all of you that watch the videos, thank you. I cannot express how grateful we are that you've joined in on the journey, and myself and the team are happy to have you along. And, to my team, thank you all for doing what you do. Enjoy the 5 million subscriber special video! 

A HUGE thanks to Tim for taking a break from filming @cookingwithlynja and filming this video.

Nick DiGiovanni,I Ate Gordon Ramsay’s Food For An Entire Day,2022-04-02 16:00:20,"This probably cost $10,000. Worth it? Absolutely. I was challenged to eat Gordon Ramsay’s food for an entire day and I did exactly that. We dined at five different restaurants in a single day and tried all of his famous dishes, ranging from the Beef Wellington to the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It’s been over a week since we did it, and I’m still full. 

Huge thanks to @gordonramsay for letting us crash all of his restaurants and @caesarspalace for giving us the suite of a lifetime.

But, I want to give a major thanks to Curt and his family for bringing us in and out in one piece.

Nutty with a powerful yet refined acorn flavor, fatty and rich, and yet so incredibly addicting. It's truly one of the most amazing foods I've come across in my life, and the process of carving and enjoying this delicacy is quite special. 

SUBSCRIBE so we can catch Gordon. We're gaining on him. We got this.

But, I truly believe this might earn me Uncle Roger's coveted title. Vietnamese pho is perhaps the most famous noodle soup in the world. 

I want to give a massive thanks to Thuy Diem Pham. I had to do my research on this one, and even though I may have still made a few mistakes, hopefully Uncle Roger will appreciate the diligence. I'm linking the recipe below as well as her Instagram handle.

Nick DiGiovanni,Pizza On Top Of The World (ft. Lynja),2022-02-19 17:29:16,"Our SECOND world record!! @cookingwithlynja called me up and asked if I wanted to take over New York. Naturally, I said yes. We made the first-ever pizza on top of the Empire State Building, found ourselves on massive billboards in Times Square, and did all sorts of classic activities throughout the whole city. What a journey.

Yes, we lit the table on fire by accident while filming this video. I cannot take my camera man anywhere these days. We headed back for a second time to Salt Bae's restaurant to check out the scene. Once again, it was completely empty but the employees and servers were fantastic. My hatred for Salt Bae runs deep, but I truly love his employees. They make this so difficult. 

In this video we made Salt Bae's $100 gold burger at home, and I'm confident it was the best burger we've made yet on this channel. Also, if you missed the last video with Salt Bae, don't forget to check it out as well: https://youtu.be/EKfAP-Su2PI

Nick DiGiovanni,Tasting Gordon Ramsay’s Beef Wellington,2022-02-12 17:00:13,"Yes, I FIRED my cameraman at the end. Today we ate at my incredible mentor Gordon Ramsay's newest restaurant in Boston. If you don't know him, he rose to fame through his cooking videos on TikTok. And, given I have lived in New England my whole life, I felt this was the perfect opportunity for the student (i.e. me) to become the teacher. And, most importantly, I wanted to try his famous Beef Wellington to finally know if it would live up to the hype. 

@gordonramsay, you remind the king of the culinary world. To all of YOU watching -- toss a like on the video, and we'll do another collab soon :) make sure to SUBSCRIBE so you don't miss it.

Then, after ordering an empty burger at each fast food location, I'll look to determine who has the best wagyu burger.

Shocked my wallet, mostly. @DavidDobrik offered up his kitchen for the day and even promised to wear his @gordonramsay t-shirt, so I had to deliver. After all, why not surprise the king of all surprises with one of his favorite foods out there? 

For the sauce, we made a nice classic Alfredo. The recipe is as follows: 

1/2 cup butter 
1.5 cups whipping cream 
2 tsp minced garlic 
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper 
2 cups fresh grated parmesan 

1. Add butter and cream to a large skillet. Simmer two minutes. 
2. Whisk in garlic, salt, and pepper. 
3. Remove from heat and whisk in parmesan until melted.

Nick DiGiovanni,"Dining On A $20,000 Flight",2022-01-05 17:00:12,"Wait until you see the entrée. I never thought I'd enjoy a meal on a plane, especially given how much I hate flying. But, when you take a three Michelin star chef and the world's best sommelier (wine expert) and have them custom design a menu in the sky, how can it not be good? 

I want to give a huge thanks to the whole staff on the plane for being so kind and generous throughout my flight. They let me film everything and were so incredibly friendly. Thanks for riding along with my in this journey!

This was the perfect holiday project. It took about six months, and on top of my usual amazing team, I was fortunate to work with a contractor, gingerbread expert, tons of “elves,” and even SANTA. Yes, the real one, who traveled from The North Pole just to visit and eat some of our gingerbread house. 

This took several thousand pounds of gingerbread to create, and we wanted to top it all off with some holiday spirit which is why we ended up buying out the ENTIRE sock racks at a number of department stores (Target, Nordstrom, Marshalls, etc) and bought many more online, all of which we gave to homeless shelters throughout Boston. 

I want to give a massive thank you to Ginger Betty and her entire team of amazing elves, as well as my good friend Kenny, our contractor, as well as Kermens, who helped throughout the project too. Could not have done it without them. 

I hope everybody had the happiest of holidays and I want to thank all FOUR MILLION of you for constantly loving and supporting the videos.

We worked for many months on this project, and getting an official world record is expensive in several ways. Getting logistics together took hundreds and hundreds of hours, and making a world record cake pop is EXPENSIVE. The rules were also extremely strict, and I have many people to thank for making this project a success. It took around 20 people to make this project happen, making it our most logistically-heavy video yet. Watch to see if it paid off!!

You won't believe the exchange I had with McDonald's on Twitter at the end of the video. The question today is simple: who has the best fast food breakfast sandwich? Like any good crispy chicken sandwich, burger, or fries, there are so many options to choose from. Today, I also brought along a random subscriber, Ryan, who was picked from the 'Community' page by my camera guy Manny. We visited the following restaurants in this video, and the results might shock you: 

Wendy's
Starbuck's 
Chick-fil-A
Popeye's (kind of) 
Burger King 
Taco Bell 
McDonald's 
Dunkin' Donuts

Thai green curry is quite complex, though as long as you stick to the traditional ingredients and ensure you achieve a smooth, properly grounded paste, things can go much smoother. Ingredients are listed as follows: 

1 tsp Coriander seeds
1 tsp Cumin seeds
1 tbsp White Peppercorns 
2 stalks Lemongrass 
3oz Kaffir Lime Zest 
3oz Galangal 
7 cloves garlic 
10 Thai Green Chilis 
1/2 cup Cilantro Stems 
1 cup fresh Thai Basil 
1/2 cup Kaffir Lime Leaves 
5 Shallots chopped 
1 tbsp Shrimp Paste 

Then, into a pan: 
1 tbsp neutral oil 
2 tbsp Curry Paste 
3 tbsp Basil Oil 
Splash of Coconut milk (13 oz) 
Diced Chicken 
Coconut Cream 
Thai Eggplant 
3 tbsp Fish Sauce 
3 tbsp Palm Sugar 
5 Kaffir Lime Leaves 
2 oz Red Bell Pepper 
1 cup Thai Basil 
White Thai Rice 

Uncle Roger (@mrnigelng), I look forward to hearing from you.

If I'm being transparent (hah, see what I did there), this was a rather pointless yet fun video to make. I mean, why turn your lemon meringue pie clear when you can just make the usual version? Because it's fun...that's why. 

A great lemon pie has several simple components: a buttery, flaky crust, a sweet and smooth lemon curd filling, and a light, frothy torched meringue on top. And with this clear lemon pie we'll be making today, that's exactly what I'm trying to mimic. Everything will remain unchanged except the filling, which may prove difficult.

Nick DiGiovanni,I Visited A Caviar Farm,2021-12-04 17:00:33,"This process will SHOCK you. I had no idea caviar was farmed and harvested this way. But that's not surprising, especially given the fact that this process doesn't happen just anywhere. I've always wondered why caviar is so expensive, but it now makes sense due to the delicate, careful and hands-on process required. Rather than being a chef in a kitchen, I felt more like a scientist in a lab, fully decked out in protective equipment. 

We were supposed to visit the farm with fish in actual tanks, though logistics didn't work out this time around. So, if you like the video and want another caviar trip, make sure to go above and toss a like on the vid, and SUBSCRIBE so you don't miss it. Finally, I want to give a huge thanks to David (https://www.instagram.com/thecaviarking_/) and Nikita for touring us around the facility, and Marky's for hosting us at their warehouse: https://www.markys.com.

Nick DiGiovanni,"Eating A $3,000 Michelin Star Dinner",2021-12-01 17:00:25,"Yes, I spent $15,000 on food in one day. But before you judge, wait until you see what three star dining looks like. In just a day, I ate breakfast at a one Michelin star restaurant, lunch at a two star, and dinner at a three star. Even getting a reservation at a Michelin star restaurant is difficult, let alone actually dining and stomaching the often steep price of the meal. 

I want to give a massive thanks to the three restaurants and their amazing teams for allowing us to document the experience and even venture into their sacred kitchens. Those of you watching should consider yourselves lucky, too. Seeing behind-the-scenes in such high-end kitchens is something truly special.

They're perhaps one of the easiest things I've ever made in my kitchen. And, if you're looking to fry something for the first time and want an easy way to test your skills, this is the recipe I'd suggest. 

Ingredient List: 
1 tbsp ground cinnamon 
1 tbsp sugar 
1/2 vanilla bean 
1/2 cup milk 
6 tbsp butter 
1 tsp salt 
1 cup AP flour 
3 eggs 
Pastry bag + closed star tip

Nick DiGiovanni,"Lobster Risotto In A $3,000 Parmesan Cheese Wheel",2021-11-20 17:07:20,"The title says it all. I shipped an entire parmesan cheese wheel from Italy (again) but instead of handmade pasta, we cooked lobster risotto. Risotto is a dish that many believe to be extraordinarily difficult. But I see it instead as a time-consuming yet highly rewarding process. In reality, all you need for a good risotto is a few great ingredients and about 30 focused minutes. 

Ingredient List: 
8 cups chicken or vegetable stock 
8 tbsp olive oil 
1.5 cups chopped yellow/white onion 
1/2 cup chopped shallots 
1/2 cup chopped scallions (green onions)  
1 tsp salt 
1 lb lobster meat + shells for stock
2 cups short-grain italian rice (arborio or carnaroli) 
1 cup white wine 
4 tbsp butter 
1 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan 
black pepper

So, I thought I'd purchase the world's most expensive wagyu, which retails around $500/LB, and really take a close look at the details. 

I also brought in random subscribers to taste the wagyu - they brought a fresh perspective, and I sent them all home with a nice big hunk to cook some dinner with. A big thanks to The Wagyu Shop for the wagyu: https://bit.ly/3smUjP0

The short answer is yes. While difficult, you can absolutely make brownies in a pizza oven. It's a bit more time-consuming and requires far more focus than using a typical oven, but it's still an experience. Thanks again to Ghiradelli for sponsoring this video!

Especially not ""fly across the country from Boston to LA and back within 24 hours"" good. Which is exactly what I did. We don't have an In-N-Out anywhere near New England, so I had to make the trip. 

Apologies on message up the buns. It happens. Perhaps it was too cold. Perhaps it was bad yeast. Or, maybe I just measured incorrectly. Ingredient list is below and should work perfectly if you have proper yeast and a warm room to rest. 

Buns: 
2 tbsp active dry yeast 
1 cup warm water 
1/3 cup vegetable oil 
1/4 cup sugar 
1 egg 
1 tsp salt

Nick DiGiovanni,Catching And Eating LIVE Sea Urchin,2021-10-29 20:20:30,"Today, I caught my favorite food in the world. Sea urchin, also known as ""uni,"" is the true embodiment of the flavor of the ocean. Uni is *technically* the sea urchin's genitals, but it tastes better than it sounds. It's delicate and therefore extremely expensive. The flavor palate includes a blast of gentle, soft cream with a smooth and briny finish, and it tastes almost impossibly good. 

Santa Barbara uni is the best in the world, right alongside uni from long across the globe (Hokkaido, Japan).  In addition to being fortunate enough to catch my favorite food today, however, I'm pleased to say that we'll be raising money to save the ocean. 

I'll keep this simple. Today, I've teamed up with @MrBeast and hundreds of other YouTubers to rally everybody around an incredibly problematic issue. We aim to raise $30,000,000, and each $1 Donated = 1 Pound Of Trash Out Of The Ocean. Visit https://teamseas.org/. OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS, I WILL PERSONALLY BE DONATING $20,000, which will translate to 1,000,000 (yes, a million) plastic water bottles being removed from the ocean. 

Huge thanks to Justin for bringing us out on a rough diving day and being such a kind, knowledgable guide. It was his first time on camera, so show him some love in the comments!! He killed it.

The terms 'fast food' and 'fancy' don't typically go together. But Shake Shack may have found a way around this. They recently released a *pricey* limited-time black truffle burger, and it costs a whopping $8.79. That's expensive for a burger. I mean, really expensive. But, naturally, I tested the burger out, brought it home and examined it, and attempted to make a better version. I ultimately put about $500 worth of black truffle shavings on it, and it was delicious. My favorite part was the homemade potato buns, which I've listed out the ingredients for as follows: 

Potato Buns 
½ lb russet potatoes (1 inch cubes) 
2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 ¼ cups (12 ⅓ oz) bread flour (plus extra if needed) 
1 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp instant yeast
1 tsp table salt

Nick DiGiovanni,I Caught and Cooked LIVE Scallops,2021-10-23 16:03:34,"Where do scallops come from? I'm sure you've eaten one at some point but have absolutely no clue what an actual scallop looks like. It may surprise you to hear that they're beautiful...and I mean absolutely gorgeous. They have vibrant blue eyes, and click their shells together to skirt across the bottom of the ocean. 

Today, we caught, cleaned, and cooked the scallops, all on the beach and ocean. HUGE thanks to Rob and Ray for making it happen. Tasting food that fresh is something that I urge you to try to do at some point in your life (regardless of what it may be, whether it's a fruit or a fish). This is one of the food experiences I'll remember for ever. 

My method for cooking scallops is simple: sear in VERY hot oil on one side until you've achieved a thick, golden-brown crust. Then, remove from the heat and season. Only sear ONE side, or you'll overcook your scallop. Enjoy! 

Check out Rob's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRH6FEPoRlqFLY_-TOs78Aw 

BIG thanks to Ray for the incredible knowledge and guidance. The scallops fear him.

Nick DiGiovanni,Squid Game Dalgona Candy Challenge In Real Life!,2021-10-16 16:35:48,"Did anybody successfully complete the umbrella?! Watch to find out. I recreated the Squid Game candy challenge in real life. We asked random strangers to be contestants, and EVERY single person agreed. They had just three minutes to attempt the challenge, and winners received a good old Benjamin Franklin. Unfortunately, we had to eliminate quite a few contestants. The things people do for $100... 

If you haven't tried at home yet, making dalgona is simple. I've seen hundreds of recipes floating across the internet, and this method is the easiest I've found yet. But one must be careful and avoid cracking it, or they'll face elimination.

Nick DiGiovanni,I Cooked A Whole Wagyu Cow,2021-10-13 16:00:30,"I almost drowned in the brisket. Seriously. This was the most intense wagyu experience of my life, and it's a day I'll never forget. Now, let me clarify. We did not actually cook an ENTIRE wagyu cow...that would've cost around $50,000, and I'd rather do just about anything else than buy a full cow. Instead, we cooked every part of a cow, with the exception of its head and private area (if you know what I mean). 

Our cooking process was extensive, particularly given the fact that we cooked every piece of meat in a completely different way. After completing the cooking process, we sat, tasted, and ranked ALL of them. And we both had completely different rankings! Watch to find out which piece of wagyu won. Giant thanks to the nicest guy ever, @GugaFoods, for inviting me into his kitchen and taking on this challenge with me head-on.

Nick DiGiovanni,I Made My Own Chef's Knife,2021-10-09 16:00:21,"Today, I made a knife by hand. Well, along with the help of a world-class Master Bladesmith. It's an extremely unique and fascinating practice, and I really enjoyed learning the basics behind the craft. We started the day with a few small pieces of steel and ended with the most beautiful knife I've ever seen...a true work of art. Some aspects of the process are intuitive, while others (for instance, the fact that the knife is soaked in instant coffee to achieve contrast in the Damascus pattern) are rather surprising.

Nick DiGiovanni,"$10,000 Edible Wagyu Candle",2021-10-06 16:00:05,"I love wagyu. I love it so much, in fact, that I decided I wanted to make my entire apartment smell like wagyu. How? By making a 50 pound candle. Over the past year, I cooked a lot of different wagyu creations: 100-day-aged, butter-aged, burger, crunchwrap supreme, sushi, and more. As I cooked, I tossed the fat scraps my freezer to the point that I had an ENTIRE freezer of just wagyu scraps. 

When moving to a new apartment a few weeks back, I wondered what on earth I could do with all this extra wagyu. Yes, it's a fortunate problem to have, but I wanted to share it (so I brought in a few random subscribers). This candle is going to keep my apartment smelling like wagyu for months (so long as I refrigerate it).

We don't deserve dogs. They are so incredibly kind to us. So grateful for everything we do for them. But I don't understand how they could possibly enjoy the food we give them. It's dry. Boring. I'm not saying we shouldn't be grateful for our food. But try to imagine eating the SAME exact thing, every single day. That's why I cooked my dog, Leo, a gourmet three-course meal. 

Course 1: Shaved Apple and Carrot Salad 
Course 2: T-Bone Steak with Apple Cider Glaze and Microgreens 
Course 3: Peanut Butter and Banana Ice Cream

Milkshakes are one of those foods that don't include all that many ingredients and must therefore be executed perfectly with only the finest ingredients. I'm a long-time fan of McDonald's, especially since I almost worked there full-time out of college, but they really dropped the ball on this one. This video wasn't the easiest I've filmed, particularly given the fact that I'm lactose intolerant, but today, I tolerated it just for you.

Just when I thought naan couldn't get any better, I added browned butter and garlic. And, not surprisingly, that did the trick. Nobody ever thinks to make naan at home, but that needs to change. It's soft and chewy, yet has those crispy bits all throughout and you can easily flavor it whatever you'd like. And, it only uses ingredients you probably already have at home. 

Ingredients: 
1/4 cup white sugar 
1/2 cup warm water 
1 packet active dry yeast 
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour 
1/2 cup plain yogurt 
1/2 tsp Osmo salt 
1 tbsp neutral oil 
3 tbsp browned butter (optional)
3 tbsp minced garlic (optional) 
Parsley and cilantro (optional)

Nick DiGiovanni,I Carbonated A Whole Watermelon,2021-09-04 16:00:19,"Thanks to Walmart+ for sponsoring this video! https://bit.ly/3jMNFy6 

Can you really carbonate fruit? Absolutely. We figured out a simple way to carbonate everything from cucumbers to watermelon. And all it took was some dry ice, patience, and a LOT of fruit, but ultimately, it actually worked. I've heard the term 'fizzy fruit' before, but we took it to a whole new level.

Ice Cream Base Recipe: 
2 cups heavy cream 
1 cup whole milk 
2/3 cup sugar 
1/8 tsp fine sea salt 
6 large egg yolks 

1. Simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar, and salt until completely dissolved (5 mins). 
2. Remove pot from heat and in separate bowl whisk egg yolks. 
3. While whisking, slowly pour in about half of the hot cream mixture. 
4. Return pot over medium-low heat and cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. 
5. Strain through a fine strainer and cool. Then place in ice cream maker (along with desired additions) and enjoy!

Nick DiGiovanni,Unofficial World Record Cake Pop (ft. Lynja),2021-08-18 16:00:01,"We really did it. We made the world's biggest cake pop. This tops the Guinness World Records for quite possibly one of the strangest cooking flexes, but it's legit. And, more importantly, WOW. Cake pops are...good! I always looked at them and simply thought they were regular circles of cake surrounded with a waxy frosting (specifically one of the ones that coats your entire mouth with a waxy feeling). But, I will admit: I was terribly wrong and misinformed. 

The cake pop is a creative and almost elegant dessert. Put simply, it tastes like cookie dough, and it's the combination of baked cake and frosting. And it's really freaking good. I've added a simple ingredient list below for those who'd like to make it at home: 

Ingredients: 
15 oz box cake mix (baked according to instructions) 
10 oz dark/white chocolate melting wafers 
1 stick salted butter 
2.5 cups powdered sugar 
1 tsp vanilla extract 
1 tbsp heavy cream 

I want to give a massive shoutout to Lynja (and her superstar son who films, Tim) for being a part of this video. Go check out their channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjvGPQTRr2eIEhthL5y31VQ

Nick DiGiovanni,I Became A Beekeeper For The Day,2021-08-11 16:00:09,"I seriously cannot believe we actually went beekeeping for this video. I like to get everything from the source, and today, I wanted to try the latest, hottest trend. This frozen honey trend has gone extremely viral in just a short amount of time, with all sorts of warnings from doctors saying NOT to try it. But, naturally, I had to do it. You've all made SO many requests, and I work for YOU. But let me first say this: DO NOT try the frozen honey trend. Or, if you do, just take a small bite, savor the moment, and stop there. I ate too much, and woke up with an extremely upset stomach. As usual, I did it for you. I took one for the team, and I'm not mad about it. 

Beekeeping is a unique experience that I'd absolutely love to do again. After all, I now own several beekeeping suits. I want to give a massive thanks to those who made this trip possible. It was such a fun trip, and certainly one of my favorites so far. I tried to make our loving cameraman go without a suit for comedic purposes, but he was being annoying about it. As for the frozen honey, if you DO want to try this trend, simply freeze honey in a water bottle for about two hours, and then squeeze and bite. It's simple, but I mean it when I say it will make your stomach hurt. Don't forget to like and sub!

Nick DiGiovanni,"Tasting Salt Bae's $1,100 Gold Steak",2021-08-07 16:10:26,"I CANNOT believe what the experience is like eating at Salt Bae's restaurant. Naturally, one would expect they make a great steak, and the truth is, they do. Or at least they did in my experience. They also have a very friendly, fantastic staff. But at what price? For a whopping final bill of nearly $3,000 for two people, they provided a meal that I could reasonably purchase and cook on my own for $150, including the edible gold leaf. Now, before going any further, I must admit. Salt Bae has built a fascinating empire around a very simple action...sprinkling salt. Yet, while impressive, I wanted to experience it all for myself. 

While I was bummed Salt Bae wasn't at the restaurant in the flesh, the staff put on quite the show and I had a great experience. I don't have plans to return purely given the price, but I'm glad I was able to experience this after  hearing so much about it on the internet. Oh, and our waiter was really handsome.

Nick DiGiovanni,Testing Popular Fried Chicken Techniques,2021-08-04 16:00:36,"There are so many ways to fry chicken. Country-fried, broasted, Korean-style, buttermilk fried, popcorn, Nashville hot, Japanese-style...I mean, the list goes on and on. Today, I'm putting a handful of the most popular methods to the test. You will not hear this often on my channel, but THERE WILL BE NO SEASONING. I know, it sounds crazy. But for the purposes of this test, I want everything to be standardized. I don't want to be thinking about salt, or pepper, or paprika, or any delicious seasoning. I just want to think about what makes the crispiest, juiciest fried chicken. 

Today, we tested just a few methods: 
1. Plain fried (no breading) 
2. Flour only (no egg) 
3. Flour and egg 
4. Potato starch 

Typically, potato starch is my favorite, but check out the video to see the results! They certainly speak for themselves.

Nick DiGiovanni,Homemade Milk Chocolate,2021-07-31 16:30:20,"I visited Ecuador for 48 hours to pick up fresh cacao fruit, then brought it back to my kitchen and made milk chocolate. This may have been the craziest thing I have ever done. Most people will eat chocolate their entire lives without ever knowing where it comes from. I want to change this, not just with chocolate but with many foods out there. Chocolate itself doesn't just grow on trees. Instead, it's a fruit. One that looks something like an alien life form, but tastes better than anybody could possibly describe. 

Think of something that's light, almost foamy. It varies in flavor but can have many notes and flavors including sweet, slightly tart, lemon, lychee, mango, pineapple, and perhaps even a very light taste of chocolate. The process then has several stages. Fermentation, drying, roasting, then grinding. Ultimately, the ground cocoa liquor is blended with additives such as milk powder, sugar, and more to create the chocolate bars we all know and love. 

I want to give a massive thanks to the MANY people that made this trip happen, specifically Blue Stripes Cacao and Bean and Co, who let us visit their farm. In fact, as mentioned in the video I've arranged with Blue Stripes to create a box (this is NOT any sort of ad, promotion, etc. They're giving you a box of goodies basically at-cost so you can experience cacao as well, at my request):

Nick DiGiovanni,Lobster Rolls From LIVE Lobsters,2021-07-28 16:00:07,"Yes, I caught my own lobsters for this video. What do you think ""from scratch"" means? Being a lifelong New Englander, I take my lobster rolls seriously. There's a heavy debate around what makes the perfect lobster roll, but let me end that debate for you now. It all starts with a soft, buttery homemade roll, lightly toasted on the outside. Inside, it should be lined with a cold filling for contrast: fresh caught lobster, bits of celery for texture, a generous serving of mayonnaise, perhaps just a bit of browned butter for nutty flavor, and optional chives and lemon juice. It's simple, but can't be beat. 

Homemade Rolls
2.5 cups lukewarm water 
1/4 cup sugar 
1 tbsp active dry yeast 
6 cups all purpose flour (+ more if needed) 
1/2 cup melted butter 
pinch of salt 
egg wash 

Lobster Salad 
1 lb lobster meat 
1/3 cup mayonnaise 
1/4 cup celery bits 
2 tbsp browned butter
2 tsp lemon juice (optional) 
2 tbsp chopped chives (optional) 
salt and pepper

And finally, after all of your requests, we've searched for the very best fries. But today was different, because we convinced a McDonald's employee (huge thanks to Kenneth for hopping out of the drive thru window to join us for the day) to come with us. Not surprisingly, his expertise on fries was unparalleled. Kenneth thought about temperature, seasoning, color, texture, and more. Let us know what we should try and rank next! Also, should we bring Kenneth again?

I CANNOT believe we pulled this off. We started a free pizza restaurant out of a Tesla. Let that sink in for just a moment. The oven was 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. We could've literally melted the car. But, somehow, it worked out and went rather smoothly. I did start smelling some melting at the beginning, but we fixed it. I want to give a huge shoutout to all the amazing people featured in this video. Thanks for stopping by and trying a quick slice. I LOVED meeting all of you. I think our overall pizza rating likely landed somewhere around the high 8's, which isn't too bad for pizza from a car. Let me know how you liked this video and whether we should do it again soon!

You know what the only thing better than a wagyu burger is? A cheese-stuffed wagyu burger. Picture this. Japanese A5 wagyu, ground into a beautiful, fatty beef. After this meat is seasoned, it's shaped into oversized patties and stuffed with cheese and sweet, sticky caramelized onions. Then, to finish things out, it's all surrounded by a crisp leaf of lettuce and fresh hunk of tomato as well as some simple special sauce and homemade buns. Now, you can stop imagining, because we actually did it. I want to give you a quick (but friendly) reminder to toss a like on the video as well as to check out The Wagyu Shop. https://bit.ly/3smUjP0

Nick DiGiovanni,Cooking Wagyu on a 500 Degree Salt Rock,2021-07-14 16:00:08,"Kobe and Wagyu beef, scallops, salmon, and bacon. Today, we cooked them all...on a huge 25 pound hot Himalayan salt rock. Yes, you read that right. It might sound crazy, but cooking on a salt slab is fun and flavorful. The process is quite similar to Korean barbecue, except when your food cooks, it's being naturally seasoned at thee same time. 

On another note, today I LAUNCHED MY FIRST COMPANY. (Edit: we sold out of everything. Re-stocking ASAP). I'm proud to say that I've been working for nearly a year with an amazing team on this, and it's finally become a reality. Osmo Salt (the name comes from the term 'osmosis' that occurs when you put salt on any food) is a collection of premium cooking salts. And, perhaps most importantly, we are also offering 169 limited-edition signed pieces you can purchase. I'm also giving away my personal chef's knife (the same one that has been used in hundreds and hundreds of videos) to one lucky winner in the first 1,000 orders. This salt will step up your game in the the kitchen. https://www.osmosalt.com/

Thank you all for the continued support. We've just hit 2.5 million. Next up, THREE MILLION!! Always remember: anyone can cook.

Nick DiGiovanni,"I Turned A $3,000 Tuna Into Sushi",2021-07-10 16:00:12,"The wagyu of the sea. Bluefin tuna is a delicacy unlike any other, and there’s a good reason single fish have sold for north of 3 million dollars. They’re fantastic. Similar to a cow, they have various different cuts of meat, all of which are very different in terms of their colors, textures, flavors, and perhaps most notably, fat content. Today, we got an 132 pound tuna and turned it into a sushi roll. And I was joined by my amazing, kind friend @GugaFoods. 

One additional note. I’m a huge advocate for the environment and this includes sustainable fishing practices. Bluefin tuna in particular have a sad history of overfishing from certain foreign fleets. This tuna came from South Africa and, to my knowledge, was sustainably harvested given each country has a certain quota. With that said, I’m constantly thinking about that balance between respecting the environment and providing content you can love and learn from, so I thought it was important to be transparent.

Nick DiGiovanni,Wagyu Katsu Sando,2021-07-07 16:00:07,"After so many requests, I made Japan's most famous sandwich: The Wagyu Katsu Sando. This is often called the most expensive sandwich in the world, and for good reason. It can cost up to $200 dollars for just a small sandwich in restaurants, but it's so simple to make. And, if you choose to make this, you can't forget about the sweet, umami katsu sauce to go with it. All I could think about when eating this sandwich was ""butter."" Yum.

Nick DiGiovanni,July 4th American Flag Cake,2021-07-03 16:00:15,"Let me be clear: I do not consider myself good at baking. Yes, I can take a simple recipe and follow the directions just like anybody else, but baking is a true art form. It's completely different from savory cooking. But with that said, I thought I'd challenge myself this year and make a vanilla layer cake in the shape of an American Flag in honor of the fourth of July. I also did the best I could in terms of ""fireworks,"" using both my Elon Musk flamethrower as well as sparkling candles. 

The cake turned out okay, but aesthetically things were lacking. I NEVER make multiple tries when it comes to my cooking. I like to show it as it is, and this is just part of the journey, so I hope you appreciate that. Every single thing you've watched on my page is and always will be done in one take. There are no ""re-do's."" Happy fourth, everybody, and enjoy!

P.S. Butcher Box is throwing in an additional $10 off of your first box on top of your FREE Bacon For Life! 

If you haven't yet discovered the pan pizza, stop what you're doing right now. You NEED it in your life. The pan pizza is not like the others. In fact, I'd argue that, if properly executed, it has the best elements from every pizza out there. On one hand, you have the cheesy deliciousness you'd look for in any pizza. On the crust, you've got deep caramelization from the sugars in the tomato sauce and the cheese near the edges. And, of course, the dough (depending on what you use) provides a fantastic flavor and chewiness. 

As promised, you smashed that like button on the previous video so I've made you the best pizza one can possibly dream of. On a separate note, I want to pause for just a moment and thank everybody for helping us pass through the 2.25 million mark. I want to be clear that I don't look at this as a number -- truly. Rather, it's a massive group of people who love food, and I'm just so incredibly grateful to each and every one of you.

Nick DiGiovanni,60-Day Butter Aged Wagyu,2021-06-26 16:00:19,"Aging beef can yield some fascinating results. Especially when that beef is wagyu. Exactly two months ago I decided to try out butter aging. And, as you  know, we take homemade seriously in my kitchen, so we started by making homemade butter. This, of course, was given a few spanks with a wooden spoon to remove excess liquid (buttermilk), and then gently molded around our entire hunk of wagyu. 

But why age meat, or anything else? Why not just save yourself the time and eat it immediately? The answer is simple: flavor. Aging concentrates the flavor and introduces new flavors through the mold (don't worry, it won't hurt you). Additionally, natural enzymes break down the connective tissue in the muscle, which leads to more tender beef. So in addition to flavor, you get a more tender final product. 

If you're at all interested in butter aging (or just dry aging, which, frankly, is easier and probably not much different in terms of final outcome), I'd start out with a large but reasonably priced cut of meat. See if you like it first...don't jump straight to wagyu. You also don't want to age a single steak portion given you'll trim it down and be left with nothing. Big thanks to The Wagyu Shop for the beef: https://bit.ly/3smUjP0

Nick DiGiovanni,KFC Crispy Chicken Sandwich,2021-06-23 16:00:03,"The new KFC chicken sandwich is on fire. It's selling twice as fast as previous sandwiches they've released, and for good reason: it's a great sandwich. But, why not learn how to make your own crispy chicken sandwich? Homemade, of course. The key to perfecting this type of sandwich? The breading. If you've ever had Popeye's, you know their sandwich has an iconic crispy breading unlike anything else out there. KFC has now gotten dangerously close to this territory, using what looks to be the exact same breading technique. Allow me to explain:

In order to get the crispy bits on the edges, you make a slightly granular and chunky breading by simply mixing in just a bit of your wet brine (the buttermilk, for instance), into your dry mixture (the flour, potato starch, or whatever it is you decide to use). Once you stir this up, it makes small clumpy bits such that when you go to dredge the chicken, you get little bits of starch on the edges that will give a beautiful look and texture to your finished product. Try it out. You got this. 

Brioche Buns: 
1/4 cup whole milk 
2 tbsp bread flour 
2 tbsp water 
3/4 cup warm milk 
2 1/2 tbsp sugar 
1 tbsp active dry yeast 
3 1/4 cups bread flour 
1 pinch salt 
1 egg + 1 yolk 
3 tbsp unsalted butter 
Egg wash 

Chicken: 
6 chicken breasts 
3 cups buttermilk 
1 pinch salt 
Garlic powder
Onion Powder 
Oregano 
Basil 
Paprika 
Pepper 

Dredge: 
3 cups potato starch 
Salt and pepper 
Paprika 
+ Buttermilk 

Pickle: 
Any good quick pickle recipe should do the trick! If you're lazy, you can just can just heat vinegar and a pinch of sugar until the sugar dissolves, then pour it over pre sliced cucumbers and let it cool in fridge. Done!

Nick DiGiovanni,Rating Fast Food Chicken Nuggets,2021-06-19 16:07:05,"There are a LOT of fast food restaurants to choose from. And one of the most exciting menu items, in my humble opinion, is chicken nuggets. Today, we've driven to Chick-fil-A, Popeye's, Shake Shack, McDonald's, Wendy's, Raising Cane's, and Burger King. All to see how their chicken nuggets, popcorn chicken, or chicken tenders (I think we can all agree that it's fair to put these in the same category) compare. Similar to our other two videos, where we found you the very best fast food burger and crispy chicken sandwich, you can think of this as your go-to guide for where to get nuggets next time you're on a road trip or just looking for a quick lunch.

Nick DiGiovanni,Salmon Sushi Pizza,2021-06-16 16:00:34,"Salmon. Sushi. Pizza. If any of those three words excites you, what I'm about to say next will surely blow your mind. Sushi pizza. Yes, you heard me right. Today we made sushi pizza from a fresh California king salmon. Now, before I go on, if you're reading this, hi. Pease take a very quick second to smash that like button below. It helps more than you could EVER, possibly imagine and my entire incredible team and I are greatly appreciative. 

Now, back to the sushi pizza. We've had regular sushi rolls, sushi bowls, sushi burritos and even sushi burgers. But I have never had or seen sushi pizza anywhere. The pizza we created in this video had somewhat of a floppy crust, and, next time, I'd love to try to make crispy rice as the whole pizza, which will then be topped with fish, whether it's tuna, salmon, eel, or really anything out there. 

I'm sure several Japanese sushi-masters would look at this video (and I really hope for both my own sake and particularly theirs that they don't find it) and cringe. But, for me, the important part here is that the rice is cooked and seasoned properly, the fish is cut into beautiful cubes and well-marinated, and the accompaniments all fit in well with the overall theme of the pizza. While this may not be the easiest or most functional way to eat sushi, I loved it.

Nick DiGiovanni,Wagyu Beef Gyro,2021-06-12 16:00:25,"Gyros are Greek sandwiches (if you can even call them that) typically made from lamb, beef, or even chicken. Biting into a gyro is an experience like no other. The variety of textures, temperatures, and flavors is unmatched. But why hasn't anybody ever made a gyro using wagyu beef? My good friend @thegoldenbalance and I carefully considered this question and wholeheartedly agreed: we had to give it a try. 

Now, you know me pretty well at this point. And this means you probably have a good understanding of my love for rotisserie chickens. The great part about gyros is that the meat is cooked on a vertical rotisserie, so this provided the perfect opportunity for me to get one of those machines. And that's exactly what we did. 

Gyro: 
Wagyu beef strips 
Paprika 
Oregano 
Chili powder 
Thyme 
Cumin 
Celery salt 
Minced onion
Olive oil
Salt 
Pepper

Bread: 
2 2/3 cups bread flour
1 tsp salt 
10 oz lukewarm water 
1.5 packets active dry yeast 
2 tbsp olive oil 

Tzatziki: 
1 medium cucumber (peeled) 
2 cups Greek yogurt 
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper 
1 clove minced garlic 
2 tbsp lemon juice 
2 tbsp fresh dill

Lemon zest

Bright Cellars is the monthly wine club that matches you with wine that you’ll love. Get started by taking the taste palate quiz to see your personalized matches.

I BOUGHT THE LARGEST BOTTLE OF WINE ON THE MARKET. Why? To make a red wine reduction for a crispy duck dish. But how, exactly, did I achieve this? By simply boiling almost all of the water out of the wine, we were left with a highly concentrated, alcohol-free, highly flavorful syrup. This was paired with a well-seasoned crispy skin duck breast and a silky smooth pomme (potato) purée. At first, I felt slightly guilty for turning such a beautiful, massive bottle of wine into such a small sauce, but once I tasted it, everything changed. 

If you ever want to impress your guests at a dinner party, take a cheap bottle of red wine and reduce it all the way to a small sauce by simply pouring it into a large pot and boiling it until there's just a small amount left. You can then add a few final ingredients and will be left with something special. You can explain to them the concept, which is unique and fun, and the flavors will blow your mind. Below, I've written some notes on the recipes and techniques used in this video. Give them a try! 

Red Wine Reduction: 
1 bottle red wine 
1 shallot (diced) 
1 cup broth 
2 tbsp butter 
1 tsp cornstarch 

Crispy Duck Breast: 
2 Duck Breasts 
3 tbsp butter

Nick DiGiovanni,Coffee Cake from 15LBS of Coffee,2021-06-05 16:00:10,"Check out Morning Brew: https://bit.ly/2Tm36Us [bit.ly] (Sponsored)

Coffee cake doesn’t actually have any coffee. That is, until today. Let’s step back for a minute. I understand the general concept around coffee cake is that you’re supposed to enjoy a slice while also sipping your morning coffee. Hence, a cake that pairs well with coffee. But why not just combine the two? Today, we’ve used about 15 pounds of coffee, which we boiled down to just a small amount and used to bake a single, magnificent coffee cake. I wanted to really concentrate the flavor, and it was awesome. 

As a side note, please don’t forget to like this video. It really helps more than you could ever know. And, for your convenience, should you choose to make a TRUE coffee cake, I’ve listed out the ingredients as follows: 

Cake
1 3/4 cups AP flour 
3/4 tsp baking powder 
3/4 tsp baking soda 
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 
1/3 cup brewed coffee 
1/3 cup sour cream 
2 sticks butter (room temp) 
1 cup sugar 
2 eggs 
1 tsp vanilla extract 

Crumb

Nick DiGiovanni,Tasting Rare Snacks and Drinks,2021-06-02 16:00:04,"Skittles Cookies. Caramel Apple Oreos. White Chocolate M&M's. Potato chips that make your mouth cold with the same sensation you get from ice cube gum. I spent months searching the globe for the rarest snacks, candies, chocolates, and drinks I could find. These came from all different countries, and not surprisingly, when some arrived, they'd been quite shaken up. Some of the drink cans were clearly beaten and weathered. A few of the chip bags had expanded and then been crushed, likely from altitude changes from flights. But, ultimately, they all landed safely in my kitchen. Watch me taste and break down all of them!

On a separate note, I want to offer a MASSIVE congratulations to our two winners, both of whom I will be sending (with their +1) to a three Michelin starred meal. If you missed it, I gave away a three Michelin starred meal in one of our recent videos (but I ended up giving it to two people cause I love you all and couldn't help myself): 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0CpeM4Wq0c&t 

Nathan will be going to the Netherlands with his father to a restaurant called The Liberije (which serves food out of a former prison). It looks mind-blowing. Madison, on the other hand, will be bringing her mother to Eleven Madison Park in New York City. I am hopeful they'll both take a short clip to share with us all once they experience these dinners, but I have reached out to them both separately already to set these dinners up. Both of you, please comment below so people can congratulate you! Also, I want to give a final thanks to my friend at Raremunchiez who helped me to secure some of these snacks. https://raremunchiez.com

Nick DiGiovanni,"$1,000 Strawberry Shortcake",2021-05-29 16:00:08,"Not surprisingly, a great strawberry shortcake requires top quality strawberries. And unfortunately, most fruit you can get at your everyday market these days isn't good. Generally speaking, it's artificially large, pumped with chemicals and pesticides, and lacks flavor. Finding a local farmers market or picking berries in the wild is a step up, but Japan takes it to a completely new level when it comes to fruit. 

In Japan, and many other countries for that matter, fruit is treated more as a luxury than a meal item. As opposed to an everyday item, fruit is oftentimes seen at holidays, special occasions, or used as a gift. This in turn means that they take their fruit production far more seriously, and I was fortunate enough to discover a company that has brought Japanese strawberries to the United States. 

Omakase berries, which come from a company called Oishii (https://www.oishii.com), are produced in an indoor farm in New York City using an indoor environment that mimics the outdoor growing conditions (rain, air, heat, light, bee-pollination) in the Japanese Alps. The resulting strawberries have an indescribable aroma, a soft and creamy texture, and are extraordinarily sweet. Each sleeve is $50, but they are more than worth it. And, I just had to make a beautiful shortcake with them. 

Macerated Strawberries 
1 lb strawberries 
3 tbsp sugar 

Brown Butter Shortbread 
2.5 cups all purpose flour 
1 cup cold browned butter 
1/2 cup + 2 tbsp sugar 
1/4 tsp salt 

Whipped Cream 
2 cups heavy cream 
1/2 cup powdered sugar 
1 tsp vanilla extract 

Strawberry Sauce
3 cups strawberries 
2 tbsp sugar 
1/3 cup water

Nick DiGiovanni,Wagyu Crunchwrap Supreme,2021-05-26 16:00:25,"Use code NICKD12 to get up to 12 FREE MEALS across your first 4 HelloFresh boxes, including free shipping on your first box at https://bit.ly/3wwLe8s

The crunchwrap supreme is actually quite good. In general, I don't go to Taco Bell often, but this offering combines all of the best elements and ingredients they offer: well-seasoned beef, a crispy tortilla, a soft and chewy exterior, lettuce strips, diced tomato, and some gooey cheese and sour cream. When executed properly, this is a genuinely brilliant concept. 

Unfortunately, they don't often execute, which is why we've taken matters into our own hands today. The ingredients themselves are actually quite simple. Creating a great crunchwrap is more about the execution. This means proportions, overall seasoning, how well you can wrap together the crunchwrap, and more. Give it a shot! It's seriously good.

Nick DiGiovanni,Rating Fast Food Hamburgers,2021-05-22 16:00:49,"Recently, we roamed the streets for the best fast food crispy chicken sandwich. Ultimately, Popeyes took home the win, but there were a number of strong contenders. Now, we've set out to find the best fast food burger. Burgers come in so many different shapes and sizes (think hamburgers, cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, all the toppings) and from so many different places. In this video, we visit McDonald's, In-N-Out (kind of), Sonic, Burger King, Wendy's, Five Guys, and Shake Shack. Each has a very different burger, and I've looked critically at them all so that you never have to wonder who has the best burger again.

Nick DiGiovanni,Crème Brûlée ft. Elon Musk Flamethrower,2021-05-19 16:00:17,"A crème brûlée is a dessert so decadent and rich that you can't have it too often. I felt that, given we just passed TWO million subscribers and it happens to be my birthday today, it's completely fair to indulge. Crème brûlée actually translates to 'burnt cream,' which is a decent--but not perfect--explanation as to what it is. A good crème brûlée consists of a creamy, smooth custard base spotted with vanilla beans, neatly topped with a sweet, hard crust of caramelized sugar. 

Now, there are a few things we should discuss that are a bit out-of-the-box in this video. First, the fact that I'm sending one of you to a 3 Michelin Star dinner for two. I'm going to put all the fine print below, but in summary I'll be paying for a trip for two people to go experience the restaurant of their dreams. I want to hear your stories. Why you want to go. Who you'd bring. Where you would go. Anything else you think may be relevant...but please keep it short and sweet! I'm going to have the winner send a clip of their experience and share it in a video down the road. 

Also, I think it's important to note here that we used an actual flamethrower to torch these. It's the Elon Musk 'Not a Flamethrower,' and I had to be safe and keep the flame to a minimum, but it was certainly a fun experience. This will officially be our go-to piece of equipment whenever we need to torch things from now on. It's a gift not really to myself, but to our channel as a whole. If you ever think of cool additions like this, please absolutely let me know in the comments below. 

Crème Brûlée Ingredients: 
5 egg yolks 
3/4 cup granulated sugar 
3 cups heavy cream 
1/4 tsp salt 
1.5 tsp vanilla bean paste (or extract) 

Giveaway Terms + Conditions: Giveaway includes $1,500 to one winner selected by me, which is what we have deemed will cover travel and dinner for two. Winner will be announced on a YouTube video in May or June of 2021. Must be 18+ to win. No purchase necessary to enter to win. Entries that don't follow http://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines will be disqualified.

Nick DiGiovanni,Giving Strangers Free Caviar,2021-05-15 16:00:00,"Free food is a wonderful thing. I remember strolling the aisles in different stores as a kid, searching for any and every free sample I could possibly find.  Think Costco, Sam's Club, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Ikea and more. Nowadays, free food is much harder to come by. Perhaps it's due to COVID. Or too many people taking advantage. But today, we brought free samples back in the best way possible. Because we did it with caviar. 

Everybody has heard the term caviar. But most people seem to have absolutely no idea what it is. Caviar is salt-cured fish roe (eggs). You've probably seen other fish eggs before (salmon, flying fish, etc) on things like sushi and more, but these are not considered caviar. Caviar solely comes from a very large fish called the sturgeon. In this video, we've handed out 50 tins of Royal Ossetra caviar, the best-of-the-best. I absolutely loved making this video and I want to send a huge thank you to everybody who agreed to be featured in this vid! 

This video was not sponsored (I have to tell you if that's the case) but Imperia Caviar did generously provide the caviar for me to hand out. While the tins we handed out could each individually retail for over $700 dollars, Imperia has the same (if not better) quality and charges closer to $45 for this same exact tin. So, if you're curious to try some, here's a link with an additional 10 percent off!! https://bit.ly/33OQdEp 

Caviar is for everybody. The same way anyone can cook, anyone can eat caviar. Even my hamster Pesto. Let me know what you want me to hand out next, and get excited for the TWO MILLION SUBSCRIBER special video next Wednesday. There's something pretty exciting in there...

Nick DiGiovanni,"$10,000 Hyper-Realistic Cake",2021-05-12 16:00:12,"If you've ever seen an object online that looked to be real but was suddenly sliced with a knife and turned out to be a cake, it was likely from one very talented cake maker. His name is Luke, and he's the mastermind behind virtually every viral realistic cake online, including the white claw can, Doritos bag, egg carton and more. So today, we decided to do something crazy. 

We turned lots of money into even more money. Let me explain. We started out with $10,000 dollars. No, that's not a joke (unfortunately for my bank account). Then, we turned this into $10,000 dollars of edible gold. And from here, Luke and I made a money and gold cake more realistic than even the money in my wallet (because there is none, since I keep spending it on things like parmesan cheese wheels from Italy). 

In all seriousness, I don't want this money going straight out the window, so I am working with a close friend to donate proceeds from this video to a good cause. Details will be in the pinned comment. Thanks for watching!

Nick DiGiovanni,Tonkotsu Miso Ramen,2021-05-08 16:00:18,"A rich, fatty tonkotsu ramen is something special. It's not like anything else in this world. And in my humble opinion, the broth is the true star. The reality is that, assuming you have the proper components, the true main ingredient in a rich and creamy tonkotsu broth is time. Consisting of an umami rich broth, boosted by a dashi-based tare, chashu pork belly, soft boiled eggs, hand-made ramen noodles (be careful not to burn your hands), and any toppings you'd like, ramen is truly one of the most delicious things on earth. This ingredient list may scare you, but at the very least, if you make anything at all here, make the broth, dashi, and tare. It will blow your mind. I promise.

Nick DiGiovanni,100 Egg Yolk Pasta,2021-05-05 16:00:16,"Homemade pasta is soft, velvety, and smooth. It's completely different from anything you can get from a box. And, get this. Things become even better when you add a delicious creamy sauce, truffles, and high-end mushrooms such as morels and wood ear. And perhaps even a bit of edible gold, too. This pasta we've made today is therefore special for so many reasons, but I've even gone so far as to use 100 egg yolks in our dough. That's right. One. Hundred. Yolks. 

That's a lot of eggs. And it was also lots of fresh pasta for my lucky neighbors. I did this to show you that, if I can make a massive fresh pasta dough with 100 eggs, you can do it with just three. Or five. I mean, at this point, you really have no excuse. Just go make some fresh pasta. 

P.S. Thanks, Isabelle, for helping so much with the cleanup. Couldn't do it without your help. Also thanks to Pesto our hamster for just being generally a great guy.

Nick DiGiovanni,"$10,000 Charcuterie Board",2021-05-01 16:00:08,"We all love a good charcuterie board. Char coochie board. Shark cutie board. Whatever it's called. They're typically filled with delicious cured meats, cheeses, veggies, nuts, olives, dried fruits, bread, crackers and more. But we figured we'd do something crazy today. We've made five different boards, starting at a dollar and working our way up to ten thousand dollars. Once we worked our way up, the boards began to include nicer versions of all the typical elements listed above but also a variety of high end, unique ingredients you may have never seen before. Think Jamón Ibérico, caviar, foie gras, and all sorts of specialty ingredients from across the globe. But this was no joke. TEN. THOUSAND. DOLLARS. All on one massive charcuterie board. 

We're also doing a few other special things with this video. First, every penny I make from this video will be donated to India to assist with the current crisis. I know it sounds crazy to spend this much on cheese and meats, but this translate directly to a large donation to a fantastic cause. If you can, toss the video a like and comment so we can send as much money as possible overseas. I will discuss on IG stories once I've submitted the first payment. On another note, I've brought in three random subscribers in this video to eat and enjoy the charcuterie board: Felix, Sej, and Judah. They we're all fantastic. I hope to bring in many more random subscribers very soon, so make sure to click that subscribe and notifications button to be next! I'm actually driving around Boston next week giving out free tins of caviar for our next vid, so look out for my goofy face in the black Tesla. 

Some of the ingredients in this video came from a few amazing spots that I often source food from, so I'm leaving links to some of my favorite items below. This isn't a sponsored vid (in fact, I legally have to tell you if it is), but I'm leaving a few links below for your own curiosity and figured I'd pick my favorite items from this board:

Nick DiGiovanni,Octopus Sushi and Rare Fresh Wasabi,2021-04-28 16:00:20,"Get $15 off your first order and an extra 5% off everything if you become a member at https://crowdcow.com/NickD

Octopus is seriously delicious. But I always find myself ordering it and never actually cooking it myself. So today, we're going to cook a large octopus until extremely tender. And, like many things in cooking, there's no need to overthink it...it's actually quite simple. Perhaps even cooler is that we have fresh wasabi, which most of you have probably never seen before. Most ""wasabi"" you get in restaurants is simply green-colored horseradish, but I'm not easily fooled. The reality is, wasabi is expensive and also loses its sharp flavor in around 15 minutes, so the fact that it's such a time-sensitive ingredient means most people don't bother using it. 

If you wish to make this octopus recipe, you can then grill or sear in a cast iron pan after cooking and cleaning. There's no need to follow my sushi steps afterward! My favorite way to cook octopus is to cook in the red wine bath (or any acidic bath), then clean off the gooey purple bits, slice into portions, and sear over high heat to get a dark crust. Then, I make a fresh, bright sauce such as a creamy cilantro sauce (yogurt, sour cream, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, seasonings). Whatever you do, enjoy! 

The octopus, wasabi, and soy sauce were from my awesome friends at https://www.regalisfoods.com. I get many of my unique ingredients from here, and felt I'd leave the link for you to check out if interested!

Nick DiGiovanni,Rating Fast Food Chicken Sandwiches,2021-04-24 16:00:04,"Who has the best crispy chicken sandwich? There are so many restaurants to choose from. Names that you've often heard get the most praise certainly include Popeyes and Chick-fil-A. But what about KFC? Or Raising Cane's? And what about the classics...McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's? There are far too many restaurants that boast a crispy chicken sandwich now, leaving the choice for consumers rather difficult. So, I've done all the hard work and drove to every single restaurant in a day (actually, we drove to Popeye's twice since the first was somehow cash-only). I taste-tested every single one, examining each sandwich and also taking into account the fact that experience can certainly vary by location. 

Ultimately, there's a list of somewhat clear winners. I'll let you watch to be surprised, but I will say that the top two spots are actually quite close. The top three, however, have very firm and stable positions. I hope that I can help for next time you try to pick a lunch on the go.

Nick DiGiovanni,Popeyes Crispy Chicken Sandwich,2021-04-21 16:00:20,"The Popeyes crispy chicken sandwich is the best. In my humble opinion, absolutely nothing comes close in the fast food world. Yet, even if you don't agree with me on this, there's one thing we can hopefully agree on: we can make it better at home. Yes, I said ""we"" -- that means YOU. So today, we've made a homemade crispy chicken sandwich with a few simple twists that bring it to a completely new level. Popeyes chicken has a unique crumbly and crispy texture around the edges, and I've worked to figure out exactly how to replicate this. And I love it so much that I'll likely be using this method from this point forward in the kitchen whenever making a chicken sandwich. Ingredients are as follows: 

Buns 
2 tbsp bread flour 
1/4 cup whole milk 
2 tbsp water 
3/4 cup whole milk (warm) 
1 tbsp active dry yeast 
2 1/2 tbsp sugar 
3 1/4 cups bread flour 
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt 
1 large egg 
1 egg yolk 
3 tbsp butter 
Egg wash 

Crispy Chicken 
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts 
1 cup buttermilk 
1 cup pickle juice 
1 tsp paprika 
1 tsp garlic powder 
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp pepper 
1 tsp salt 
1 cup potato/corn starch 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
Frying oil 
Pickles (for topping) 

Mayo 
1 cup mayo 
2 tbsp chives 
1 tsp lemon zest 
1 tsp salt

Nick DiGiovanni,Parmesan Cheese Wheel Pasta,2021-04-17 16:00:07,"Cheese wheel pasta has constantly been featured across the internet, so I finally had to give it a try. So, we shipped an 80 pound parmesan cheese wheel straight from Italy. The first trip, it was damaged in transit. I don't know exactly what that means...did it roll off the truck? Did somebody ""accidentally"" damage it so they could eat it? I mean, who doesn't want some fresh Parmigiano Reggiano. But it really does make me think. Hmm... 

But the second trip, it made it all the way to my kitchen in Boston. After learning the delicate yet demanding process of opening the cheese wheel, we dug out a ""bowl"" within the cheese, lit it on fire to get a cheesy sauce, then added our fresh, homemade egg pasta to with some garlic cream sauce and blended it together. The result? Indescribable. 

Homemade Pasta 
2 cups all-purpose flour 
2 eggs + 4 yolks 

Cream Sauce 
1/2 cup butter 
4-6 cloves garlic 
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
2 cups heavy cream

Nick DiGiovanni,Live Soft Shell Crab Sushi,2021-04-14 16:54:49,"As you probably know, whole crabs in general are difficult to find in your everyday market. Live crabs are, of course, even harder to find. But I've struck gold, and it's even better than regular old live crabs. Today, we're making sushi from live soft shell crabs. Soft shell crabs are an absolute delicacy. You can eat virtually the entire crab, and it's one of the juiciest things you'll  ever experience. They're typically Japanese blue crabs, oftentimes from Maryland. And when you wrap this all into a sushi roll, you get something truly special. 

I want to take a moment here to also thank you all for 1.7 million. It's been such a fun journey and it is my hope that this is just the beginning. Let's keep making food together!

Nick DiGiovanni,Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich,2021-04-10 16:00:02,"Chick-fil-A vs. Popeye's is an eternal battle, and I love it. They keep each other in check, making sure both stay at the top of their game. And that's why they're both so delicious. Thus, it makes sense that one of the most requested food items people want me to recreate (and dominate) is always a ""homemade Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich."" And, I get it. It's good. Like, really good. Personally, I'm a Popeye's guy myself, but I understand the merits of both. And Chick-fil-A has a far superior sauce selection which is of utmost importance, too.

Nick DiGiovanni,Beef Wellington Made Easy,2021-04-07 16:00:14,"When you think of Beef Wellington, oftentimes the first name that comes to mind is Gordon Ramsay. But first, what the heck is it? You essentially sear the beef before wrapping it in layers of duxelles, prosciutto, and pastry. In essence, you sear a beef tenderloin (basically a long filet mignon) before wrapping it in layers of duxelles (minced mushroom blend), prosciutto, and pastry. This dish that originated in England is known by many to be one of the most daunting recipes for any home cook...but I'm going to show you that it's not that bad after all. 

This was cooked to an internal temperature of 129 Fahrenheit, which is on the higher end of the ""rare"" spectrum. You can cook yours longer or shorter, but NO. This is not raw. If you're interested in getting yourself some tenderloin, the link to The Wagyu Ship is as follows: https://bit.ly/3smUjP0. 

Ingredients: 
1.5-pound beef tenderloin 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
2 sheets puff pastry 
6 slices prosciutto
2 egg yolks + water (egg wash)
flaky salt to taste 
finely chopped chives (garnish) 

Duxelles:
1 pound assorted mushrooms 
2 shallots
3-4 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine 
3 bay leaves 
salt and pepper to taste

Crepe:
1 cup all-purpose flour 
1 tbsp granulated sugar 
2 eggs 
pinch of salt

Mustard: 
3 tbsp brown mustard seeds 
3 tbsp yellow mustard seeds 
1/3 cup white wine vinegar 
1/3 cup white wine 
1 tbsp minced shallot 
salt and pepper to taste 
pinch of allspice

Nick DiGiovanni,"Honey Ham vs. Watermelon ""Ham""",2021-04-03 16:09:49,"There's nothing like a good spiral ham. Now, if given the option between ham and most other meats, I'd probably choose the others. But there's something special about a caramelized, well-glazed honey ham. You'll likely buy this pre-cooked, and all you have to do to bring it to the next level is mix a few common ingredients together to make something truly special. 

But what about vegans? Not to worry. I've also made a watermelon ""ham."" And you might ask, why on earth would anybody EVER turn a ham into a watermelon, but don't knock it til' you try it. This is one of those things that sounds a bit odd, even looks incredibly weird, but somehow...kinda works. It's soft, juicy, slices just like meat and almost has the texture of raw fish the more your watermelon dehydrates. So, so unique.

Nick DiGiovanni,French Onion Burger,2021-03-31 16:29:23,"French onion soup is so frickin' good. It really is. But so often, I feel like it's this sad, watery bowl of lazily made broth with a few bits of onions that are most definitely not caramelized. Today I'm taking French onion soup to the next level with an insane french onion burger. 

This french onion burger has the best of the best all around. A soft, fluffy homemade bun, some deeply caramelized onions, some Japanese wagyu, grated Gruyere cheese, and a delicious beef stock glaze. This was, to put it simply, one of the best five burgers I've ever experienced.

Nick DiGiovanni,Salt Cured Egg Yolks,2021-03-28 16:03:02,"Today, we'll cure some duck and egg yolks and use them to create a beautiful wagyu pizza. This pizza is something that, quite truthfully, will blow your mind. Cured egg yolks are something special. Creamy, soft, umami packed. They're hard to describe, and that's why you should make them at home. Other than the time required to let them cure, this is a very straightforward process. The most difficult decision here is actually knowing what to pair them with when complete. Will it be a risotto? Pizza? Or perhaps totally new and different? 

Cured Egg Yolks 
4:5 Ratio of Sugar:Salt
12 egg yolks 

1. Combine sugar and salt in blender and pulse until it reaches a fine powder. 
2. Spread half the mixture on a baking sheet. 
3. Make 12 indents with bottom of an egg, then separate out 12 egg yolks and add to your tray. 
4. Cover each yolk with the remaining sugar and salt. 
5. Cover tray with plastic wrap and rest in fridge for one week. 
6. Remove from fridge and brush off each yolk, then rinse off salt in cool water. 
7. Add yolks to wire rack on baking tray and place in 150 degree Fahrenheit oven. Let dry for two hours. 
8. Shave over whatever you desire! It will grate just like parmesan cheese.

Nick DiGiovanni,Chocolate Chip Cookies,2021-03-25 16:00:01,"Congratulations. You’ve found the recipe for the best cookie in the world. I’ve done far more research than I’d like to admit. I’ve surveyed a number of sweet grandmas—we all know they’re the true cookie pros. They simply can’t be beat. I’ve looked at scientific articles, innumerable recipes and done all sorts of testing. This is the one. 

These cookies have something special about them I learned in a science course in college a few years ago. I loved the flavor of browned butter. But, browning the butter often means adding in melted butter, which changes the texture of the final product. So, in addition to adding cold butter, I add toasted milk powder. When butter browns, the milk solids are what get toasted and nutty, so this is basically the same as adding in a ton of browned butter. 

I also add malted milk, which boasts a unique but incredible flavor unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. This, coupled with a perfect balance of all other ingredients makes for a chewy, cakey, nutty, crispy, and overall perfect cookie.

Ingredients: 
1 cup cold butter (cubed) 
1 cup brown sugar 
1/2 cup sugar 
2 eggs 
2 3/4 cups all purpose flour 
1/4 cup milk powder 
1/4 cup malted milk powder 
1 tsp cornstarch 
3/4 tsp baking soda 
3/4 tsp flakey salt 
2 cups chocolate chips 

1. Preheat oven to 415 degrees Fahrenheit. 
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.
3. Add eggs one by one while mixing or whisking on medium speed. 
4. Toast milk powder until lightly golden brown and aromatic. 
5. Add flour, cornstarch, baking soda, milk powders, and salt. 
6. Mix chocolate chips in, reserving some to press in evenly on cookies at end. 
7. Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie sheet. I fit about six on a cookie sheet. 
8. Bake 9-12 minutes until golden brown. Let them rest, or immediately eat with a spoon and some vanilla ice cream.

Nick DiGiovanni,Moonfish Sushi,2021-03-23 17:35:09,"We're back with yet another sea to sushi video. The fish I've used today is a funny looking fella'. The Peruvian Moonfish has to be one of the most unique looking, skinniest fish in the sea. But, big or small, skinny or wide, we can make ANY fish into a sushi roll. We'll use some traditional Japanese ingredients and techniques while also adding our own spin in this one. As always, I like to mix things up a bit when cooking. This fish tastes like somewhat of a cross between tuna and salmon, so it made a fantastic sushi roll, though I didn't feel comfortable eating it raw--hence the tempura!

Nick DiGiovanni,Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge from a Cacao Pod,2021-03-16 16:00:06,"Fudge. It's so good. So rich. And when you combine chocolate and peanut butter to create fudge, it's out of this world. As usual, I'm challenging myself to make the fudge from a cacao pod, but you can simply start with some bittersweet chocolate chips and make the same mind-blowing fudge. The best part is, it's such an easy recipe. You never have to buy fudge again. 

Ingredients: 
3 cups (600 grams) granulated sugar 
3/4 cups (170 grams) butter
2/3 cups (168 grams) evaporated milk 
12 oz bittersweet chocolate chips
7 oz marshmallow fluff 
1 tsp vanilla extract 
1 cup (240 grams) peanut butter 
1 cup (125 grams) confectioners' sugar 
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 

Instructions: 
1. Line a 9x13 inch pan with parchment.
2. In large saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, butter, and evaporated milk. 
3. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat when it reaches 234 Fahrenheit. 
4. Immediately stir in chocolate chips until melted and well combined. 
5. Fold in marshmallow fluff and vanilla extract. Fully combine and set aside. 
6. In medium bowl, combine peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, and melted stick of butter. 
7. Swirl peanut butter mixture into fudge. Try to get a nice pattern. Add optional salt on top. 
8. Transfer fudge to parchment-lined pan and let cool for 2 hours. 
9. Slice and enjoy!

Nick DiGiovanni,"Cooking with a $1,500 Leg of Jamón Ibérico",2021-03-13 17:12:19,"Prosciutto is special. Jamón Ibérico is a level above this. And Cinco Jotas Jamón Ibérico is a level beyond that. What I have today is a full hind leg of Cinco Jotas, the full hind limb of an Iberian pig that's been fed nothing but acorns throughout the entirety of its life, only to be serenaded before death by Mozart (no joke) and cured by a ham master (yes, that's a real thing). 

Jamón Ibérico is the holy grail of Spain. It is uniquely addicting, boasting such a wonderfully developed flavor filled with hints of nuttiness and an indescribably buttery texture. I've procured this Jamón from La Tienda, a special shop with innumerable Spanish foods. The link to their website is here: https://www.tienda.com. 

Today, I've made three dishes with this. Our appetizer is Pan con Tomate, a traditional Spanish dish that I've placed my own personal spin on. Next we have an entrée of Pasta Carbonara, replacing the traditional Guanciale (an Italian salt-cured meat) with Jamón Ibérico. And finally, our ""dessert"" is a sweet treat consisting of a Jamón wrapped date, all enveloping a small bit of creamy blue cheese. 

Pan con Tomate: 
Jamón slices 
1/2 cup olive oil 
1 cup warm water 
2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast 
1/4 tsp honey 
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
1/2 tsp sea salt 
Heirloom tomatoes 
1 head garlic 
1/2 cup olive oil 
Salt and pepper
Thyme or Rosemary 

1. In a large bowl combine water, yeast, and honey. Stir and let sit 10 minutes.
2. In mixer, slowly add flour and olive oil. Allow the machine to knead until well combined. 
3. Remove from mixer and knead 2-3 minutes until you have a smooth ball. Cover in greased bowl and rest 1 hour. 
4. Slice the top off your head of garlic, then place in ramekin and cover with salt, pepper, and olive oil. 
5. Bake garlic in oven 30 minutes at 400 Fahrenheit or until golden brown and bubbly. 
6. Grease a baking tray with your garlic olive oil, then press your focaccia into the pan. Cover again 20-30 minutes to rest. 
7. Sprinkle focaccia with olive oil, salt, and fresh herbs if desired. Bake at 450 Fahrenheit 15-20 minutes until golden brown. 
8. Rub garlic and tomato over your bread, then layer Jamón and finish with a drizzle of honey. 


Pasta Carbonara: 
1 lb dry pasta (can make fresh if desired) 
4 large eggs 
8oz Jamón cubes 
Jamón slices 
1 cup Parmesan
Salt and pepper 
Olive oil 

1. For Jamón chips, preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit and layer a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
2. Add Jamón evenly across baking sheet and bake 10-15 minutes until crispy. Let them sit on a wire rack until cooled. They will firm up after reaching room temperature. 
3. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add a generous handful of salt. Add pasta and cook until al-dente.
4. Set aside 1/2 cup pasta water and oil pasta such that it doesn't stick together. 
5. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add Jamón and sauté for 3 minutes, or until fat is rendered. Turn off the heat.
6. In a small bowl, whisk eggs and cheese until well-combined.
7. Return Jamón to medium heat and add spaghetti and pasta water. Heat until most of the water has evaporated, then remove pan from heat and add egg mixture. 
8. Stir constantly so eggs don't overcook, then season with fresh pepper. 
9. Finish with parmesan cheese and Jamón chips. 


Jamón Date: 
10 Medjool dates
10 small slices Jamón 
4 tbsp blue cheese 

1. Preheat oven to 375 Fahrenheit. 
2. Slice open dates and remove pits. 
3. Fill dates with a small pinch of cheese, then pinch to close. 
4. Wrap each date in Jamón, then layer on parchment lined baking sheet. 
5. Bake 15 minutes until Jamón is crispy. Rest and enjoy.

Nick DiGiovanni,Chocolate Soufflé from Cacao Pod,2021-03-10 18:08:13,"This was insanely good. A soufflé is known as one of the most difficult things a cook can pull off. It really is tricky to make, but damn, do they taste great. There's also something about using a beautiful, fresh cacao pod that makes this even better. In additional to making a beautiful chocolate soufflé that you can follow along with here, we're making a crème anglaise, a light pouring custard used as a sauce for a number of desserts. Don't worry! You can make this exact recipe without the cacao pod. Follow for a delicious soufflé below: 

Soufflé Ingredients: 
Softened butter
1/4 cup sugar 
2 oz bittersweet chocolate 
1 tbsp butter 
1 tbsp all purpose flour 
4 tbsp cold milk 
2 eggs (separated yolks/whites) 
1 tsp cream of tartar 
1 tbsp sugar 

1. Brush your ramekins with butter, brushing up the sides to help the soufflé rise. 
2. Add your 1/4 cup sugar evenly across the ramekins, and evenly coat the insides. Set aside. 
3. Over a double boiler, melt chocolate and set aside. 
4. Add butter into a small pan, followed by flour. Whisk until well-combined over medium heat. 
5. Add cold milk, then whisk and fold into chocolate mixture. Set this aside. 
6. Separate out your eggs, discarding one yolk. 
7. Add egg whites and pinch of cream of tartar to mixing bowl, and when you reach small peaks add white sugar. Stop mixing when it reaches stiff peaks. 
8. Gradually fold the meringue in, bit by bit, into the chocolate mixture. 
9. Fill your ramekins with the mixture, leveling off the tops. 
10. Bake at 400 Fahrenheit (200 C) for 12-15 minutes until risen. 

Crème Anglaise Ingredients: 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 1/2 cups whole milk 
1/2 cup sugar 
2 tsp vanilla bean paste 
6 egg yolks 

1. Combine cream, milk, sugar and vanilla over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. 
2. Separate out egg yolks and whisk until lighter in color. 
3. Temper in some of the warm milk mixture while still whisking the eggs. This will bring the eggs up to temperature. Then, combine everything back into the pan over medium heat and whisk until thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Pour over soufflés and enjoy!

Nick DiGiovanni,Cooking a Silkie Black Chicken,2021-03-06 17:48:44,"Silkie chickens are a prized breed of chicken with a beautiful and fluffy (yet misleading) set of white feathers and black skin. The chicken flesh itself is a dark bluish-gray or even black, and the bones are also black. Ultimately, however, they taste like...well, chicken. The one difference I noticed is that they taste a bit gamier, likely due to the fact that unlike the factory-farmed chickens we are used to, they are free-range and naturally raised. 

The mayonnaise trick is odd, I know. But I've been using mayo for years to get extremely crispy and buttery roasted potatoes, and if you consider the fact that it's just oil with a bit of egg, it makes more sense. Search the web and you'll immediately find a plethora of recipes with mayo fried chicken wings. Try it out!

Nick DiGiovanni,Pretzel Bun Wagyu Burger,2021-02-28 17:33:25,"A well-balanced burger is hard to top. This recipe has it all. A soft, chewy, and crunchy pretzel bun. A fatty, buttery, hand-ground wagyu patty. A few different types of cheese for that gooeyness. A special sauce that will blow your mind. Crispy onions. The list actually keeps going, but I think I've proved my point. 

Pretzel Bun Recipe: 
2 cups warm milk (110 F) 
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 F) 
2 tbsp vegetable oil 
1 tbsp active dry yeast 
1 tbsp sugar or honey
7 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup baking soda
Salt (to taste) 

1. Combine milk, water, vegetable oil, yeast, and sugar. Rest 10-15 minutes. 
2. While whisking, add flour. Knead until well combined and smooth, about 8 minutes. You may have to add a bit more flour to hit that right consistency. 
3. Add to greased bowl and cover with a damp kitchen towel to rest. 
4. Cut into balls and shape into buns. Rest again for 15 minutes. 
5. Add baking soda and salt to boiling water and cook your buns 30 seconds  or so on each side. 
6. Use a sharp knife to quickly slit the top of your buns. Be creative with the designs!
7. Add to baking sheet (with parchment or silipat) at 425 Fahrenheit for  20-22 minutes. 
8. Slice and enjoy.

Nick DiGiovanni,Mexican Mole,2021-02-20 19:22:47,"Mexican mole is a sauce, unlike anything I have ever experienced. Looking at the ingredients list, you may get a bit nervous...but fear not. This is a straightforward process to follow, and the end result is nothing short of incredible. 

The recipe I used in this video is not exactly traditional (I had access to only a certain selection of chiles), but otherwise, I did my best at sticking closely to tradition here. Again, this is a truly special sauce and I assure you, should you dare to try this out, it'll result in something you won't ever forget. 

Ingredients 
1 whole chicken 
1 stick butter
2 cups chicken broth 
2 dried guajillo chiles 
2 dried ancho chiles 
3 dried chipotle chiles 
1 dinner roll 
2-3 corn tortillas 
2 tomatoes 
6 tomatillos 
1 tbsp butter 
2 yellow onions 
1/2 head garlic 
1/3 cup chopped peanuts 
1/4 cup raisins 
2 tbsp cumin seeds 
1 tbsp dried thyme 
3 cinnamon sticks 
5 whole cloves 
6 whole allspice berries 
5 oz dark chocolate 
1 cup chicken broth 
3 tbsp white sugar 
Salt (to taste) 

1. Remove stems and seeds from all chiles and prepare all ingredients. 
2. Wedge butter between skin and meat of chicken. 
3. Add chicken to a pot with chopped onion, a handful of salt, and cover with water. 
4. Cook at 300 Fahrenheit until chicken is soft and tender, about 2.5 hours. 
5. Toast chiles in a dry pan until aromatic and slightly charred. 
6. Add 2 cups of chicken broth to deglaze the pan. Then, add all contents to a blender and set aside. 
7. Next, add your chopped tortillas and roll them into a dry pan and slightly brown. Add this to the blender and pulse. 
8. Peel and chop your tomatillo and tomatoes (I subbed tomato paste and sauce). Add to the dry pan once again and blister a few minutes over medium-high heat. Add to blender and pulse. 
9. Add 1 tbsp butter to the pan, then add one chopped onion, peanuts, raisins, cumin seeds, dried thyme, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and allspice berries. Cook until onions are softened. 
10. Pick out whole spices (namely cinnamon sticks, cloves, and allspice berries), and add the remaining contents to a blender. Blend until smooth. 
11. Pour this mixture into a larger pan over medium heat. Add chopped chocolate, more broth if needed, sugar, and salt. 
12. Stir until well combined and reduce to the proper consistency. 
13. Pour over chicken, rice, whatever you want! It is INCREDIBLE.

BREAKING DOWN A CHICKEN BLINDFOLDED
Thank you for watching this video.",PT53S,Have tags,14915576,906238,6868,0,0.8833333333333333,thursday,2021,2,18,0.061218286172790105,1
Nick DiGiovanni,Basil Pesto,2021-02-17 17:00:21,"Homemade pesto is magical. The moment you take the lid off that blender and smell that warm, fragrant steam, your mind is blown. It's one of the few times in the kitchen where I take a pause and just smell for a while. This recipe is really something special. 

Today, we do indeed have a special guest. My hamster, Pesto, not to be confused with edible basil pesto. Too many people have come after him with ""recipe"" ideas on how to cook him, but today, he's a judge right alongside me for the very food from which he got his name.

Pasta 
2 cups all-purpose flour 
3 eggs + 2 yolks 
2 tbsp olive oil 
1/2 cup salt 

Pesto 
2 cups packed fresh basil 
2 cloves garlic 
1/4 cup pine nuts + 1/4 cup for garnish
2/3 cup olive oil 
1/2 cup grated parmesan + more for garnish 

1. Add flour to the cutting board and make a well (hole) in the middle with a bowl. 
2. Add eggs, yolks, and olive oil to the well and whisk until well combined. 
3. Slowly incorporate the flour into the middle until the mixture is uniform, then use your hands to knead the dough together until smooth. 
4. Place in the fridge with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes. 
5. Roll out pasta dough as usual into whatever shape you want. 
6. Cook pasta in salted boiling water, then toss in a bit of olive oil and set aside. 
7. Blanch (cook) basil 15 seconds in boiling water, then cold shock in ice water. Dry it off immediately after. 
8. Roast garlic in a bit of olive oil over medium heat, then set aside. 
9. Toast pine nuts until golden brown and aromatic, then set aside. 
10. Combine all ingredients in blender and pulse until well combined. 
11. Toss pesto with pasta and enjoy. Try not to heat this up too much, as the olive oil will separate and cheese will release oil. The best way may be a quick pulse in the microwave. Enjoy!

Nick DiGiovanni,Parrotfish Sushi,2021-02-11 16:59:48,"Yes, a parrotfish is real. And it makes for some great sushi! 

Everybody should know how to make sushi. And this basic recipe for sushi is coupled today with a beautiful parrotfish. Now, these are extremely important for coral reef ecosystems, and while this fish itself isn't taken from an area where it was desperately needed, I think this can serve as a video to bring awareness to the fact that many coral reefs are suffering right now. It's just a good reminder to everybody to think hard about where your food comes from.

This is easy, homemade tanghulu. Many people see it and love it, but they don't know how to make this tasty snack. It's such a delicious treat, and while it might be sugary (and your dentist may not be too happy, as I know from personal experience), it's fun. So let's answer the question. Pastry: does it tanghulu? 

Ingredients: 
2 cups sugar 
1 cup water
wooden skewers 

1. Combine sugar and water over medium-high heat and don't stir. 
2. Allow to heat to 300 F or about 150 C, then turn off heat and dip your fruits or other food into the liquid. 
3. Immediately plunge into a cold water bath to harden the sugar and enjoy! 
4. To clean your pan, add water and boil over high heat. Repeat once or twice and your sugar will dissolve from the edges of your pan! DO NOT try to scrape it off.

Nick DiGiovanni,Potato Gnocchi,2021-02-05 17:48:00,"Soft, pillowy, cheesy and creamy. Doesn't that sound amazing? Well, it is. Homemade pasta can be scary, but gnocchi is easy. If you can make mashed potatoes, you can make gnocchi. I absolutely, totally promise. And, you can't mess up the cooking or doneness since it floats when finished! If you want to go the extra mile, you can sear them in some butter to get a nice golden crust on each bite, too. 

Ingredients: 
2 lb russet potatoes (4 medium) 
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour 
1 large egg (beaten)  
3 tbsp butter 
1/2 cup parmesan (grated) 
Salt

1. Peel potatoes and add to bowl of cold water immediately after peeling. Try to give potatoes minimal exposure to air. 
2. Boil in large pot for about 25 minutes or until fork tender. 
3. Drain and cover with kitchen towel to steam for 5 minutes. 
4. Smash through potato ricer into bowl or cutting board. 
5. Add egg, lightly mix, then add flour. Truthfully, all at once is okay. 
6. Mix very gently. Don't mash or squeeze. Keep it light and fluffy. 
7. Roll gnocchi with just enough flour that it doesn't stick. Cut with a knife or bench scraper. 
8. Boil water in a large pot or sauté pan with a generous handful of salt. 
9. When water comes to a boil, add gnocchi and cook until it floats. 
10. Optionally, sear in some butter until golden brown. 
11. Add a bit of parmesan, and any other desired seasonings or additions. Enjoy!

Today, I’m using the best of the best, making one of my favorite recipes ever: crispy rice salmon. Basically think of this as nigiri, but heavily upgraded. You season the raw salmon with a few delicious coatings, then place it atop a crispy fried disc of sushi rice. Trust me on this one…make it at home. 

Ingredients: 
1 lb sushi-grade salmon 
1 tbsp soy sauce 
1 tsp mirin 
1 tsp sesame oil 
3 tbsp mayo 
Crispy fried onions 
1 tbsp furikake 
2 cups cooked sushi rice 
Ring mold (optional) 
Green onions 

1. Cut salmon into small cubes and place in bowl.
2. Add soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, mayo, fried onions, and furikake and combine. 
3. Fry sushi rice in discs at about 375 Fahrenheit or until golden brown. 
4. Top sushi rice rings with salmon, then sprinkle a few finely chopped green onions. 
5. Enjoy!

Nick DiGiovanni,Wagyu Burger,2021-01-29 17:04:05,"Wagyu. We all know and love it. Oftentimes, I feel terrible turning wagyu into something other than simple, delicious strips with some light flakey salt. But once in a while, it's nice to take a basic food and make it truly extraordinary. And that's exactly what I've done here. All from scratch. 

Ingredients: 
1 cup + 2 tbsp warm water 
2 tbsp active dry yeast
1/3 cup vegetable oil 
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
3 cups AP flour 
Salt (to taste) 
16oz Wagyu (or other) beef 
1 cup white vinegar 
1 cup water 
Salt (to taste) 
2 small cucumbers
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 tbsp ketchup 
1/4 cup chopped pickles
Hot sauce (pinch) 
Salt + Pepper
Lettuce (optional) 
Tomato (optional) 
Bacon (optional) 

1. To make buns, combine water and yeast. Whisk. 
2. Add vegetable oil and sugar, and whisk again. Let this sit for 5 minutes. 
3. Add egg, flour, and salt in mixing bowl and knead about 3-5 minutes until smooth and elastic. 
4. Drop dough onto floured board and cut into six balls. 
5. Roll into small balls and sit on greased tray. 
6. Let dough rest several minutes and grind wagyu. 
7. After resting dough balls for 10 minutes, paint them in egg wash. 
8. Bake at 425 Fahrenheit (218 C) for 10 minutes or until golden brown. 
9. For pickles, add vinegar, water, and salt to small saucepan and heat until sugar dissolved. Pour over sliced cucumber and let sit 15 minutes. 
10. Egg wash buns again and add sesame seeds. Place back in oven until seeds are set. 
11. For special sauce, combine mayo, ketchup, pickles, hot sauce and S+P. 
12. Sear beef in ring molds to get perfect shape, then add cheddar and steam until melted. 
13. Slice and toast buns. 
14. Assemble burger to your liking and enjoy.

Nick DiGiovanni,Making Brownies From A Cacao Fruit,2021-01-26 18:57:55,"These brownies should be called ""lava cake brownies."" They're the perfect hybrid between a crispy, crumbly exterior and a gooey, chewy interior. I am not kidding when I say that these are, hands-down, the best brownies I have ever had. And you can make them, too. You can just start with cocoa powder instead of cacao pods! Recipe below: 

Ingredients: 
1/3 cup cocoa powder 
1 1/2 tsp instant coffee granules 
1/2 cup + 2 tbsp boiling water 
2 oz unsweetened chocolate 
1 stick melted butter 
1/2 cup + 2 tbsp vegetable oil 
2 eggs + 2 yolks 
2 tsp vanilla extract 
2 cups granulated sugar 
1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 
Salt (to taste) 
Cacao nibs (optional) 
Chocolate chips (optional) 

1. Combine cocoa powder, coffee, and boiling water and blend.
2. Chop the chocolate and add to the bowl, whisking again until smooth.

Nick DiGiovanni,Fruit Tanghulu,2021-01-15 23:59:40,"Tanghulu is one of the tastiest treats out there. Most people know it as a street food snack, often with hawthorn or strawberries on sticks with the hardened sugar coating. You can get the fruit from https://miamifruit.org/ and https://tropicalfruitbox.com. Each have different and unique fruits and I've tried just about everything they offer. The recipe is simple, and as follows: 

Ingredients 
2 cups sugar 
1 cup water
wooden skewers 

1. Combine sugar and water over medium-high heat and don't stir. 
2. Allow to heat to 300 F or about 150 C, then turn off heat and dip your fruits or other food into the liquid. 
3. Immediately plunge into a cold water bath to harden the sugar and enjoy! 
4. To clean your pan, add water and boil over high heat. Repeat once or twice and your sugar will dissolve from the edges of your pan! DO NOT try to scrape it off.

2 cups buttermilk 
2 cups pickle juice 
2/3 cup hot sauce
1 stick butter
1/3 cup mayonnaise 
1.5 tbsp white vinegar 
1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce

Garlic powder (to taste) 
1.5 cups potato starch 
2 tsp garlic powder 
2 tsp truffle salt 
2 tsp onion powder 
2 tsp chili powder 
Pepper (to taste) 

1. Brine wings in buttermilk and pickle juice for 30 minutes. 
2. Combine hot sauce, butter, mayo, vinegar, Worcestershire, truffle salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder in a small pot over medium heat until well combined. 
3. In a medium bowl, combine potato starch, garlic powder, truffle salt, onion powder, chili powder, and fresh cracked pepper. Whisk to combine. 
4.  Dredge wings in potato starch mixture and tap off excess. 
5. Fry wings at 325 Fahrenheit for 5-6 minutes or well cooked. 
6. Heat oil to 375 Fahrenheit, then fry again a few minutes until golden brown. 
7. Toss in buffalo sauce and enjoy. I dip mine in a combo of ranch and blue cheese, which is weird, but they're also perfect without added sauce.

But I wanted to think outside the box today, so we're going to add another element of flavor and deliciousness: smoke. Our sushi thus far has been delicious but fairly basic, and this will give a unique twist that I'm excited to experience. The recipe for my snapper sushi is as follows: 
 
Ingredients: 
1 Snapper or Sushi Fish 
2 tbsp Sesame Oil 
2 tbsp Mirin 
2 tbsp Soy Sauce 
Applewood smoking chips 
5 sheets Nori 
2 cups cooked Sushi Rice 
Cucumber (optional) 
Japanese Mayo
Furikake

1. Fillet fish and cut into thin strips. 
2. Smoke with applewood or another flavor of chips in a sealed bowl with mirin, soy sauce, and sesame. 
3. Roll sushi as usual and add whatever other toppings you might like. I used cucumber, Japanese mayo and Furikake.

Nick DiGiovanni,Quesa Birria Tacos,2020-12-30 23:13:16,"Well, this is the most delicious taco I have ever had, if you can even put it into that category. This, as far as I'm concerned, deserves a category of its own. It's more like a quesadilla-taco hybrid, taking the best from both sides. General recipe is as follows (I used non-traditional chilis since I'm a baby with spice but you can do whatever makes you happy): 

10-12 assorted chilis or peppers 
1/2 cup vinegar 
1/3 cup olive oil 
1/2 onion 
handful cilantro 
cinnamon 
other assorted spices
salt and pepper
1 12-16oz steak (chuck roast most common) 
Oaxaca cheese 
Small corn tortillas

1. Combine seeded and charred peppers, vinegar, olive oil, onion, cilantro, and spices in blender. You can get creative with the spices! 
2. Sear steak about a minute in an oven-safe pan and then pour over the sauce from above. 
3. Cook it in the oven over low heat (about 250-300 F) for several hours until the meat is fork tender. Pressure cooking is also a great option. 
4. Dredge the tortillas in your sauce and straight onto a hot pan. Add small cubes of cheese along with your meat, and press the tortilla in half over the fillings to make a meat-filled quesadilla. 
5. Dip in your Birria sauce and enjoy. It's mind-blowingly good.

Nick DiGiovanni,This Recipe Takes One Year,2020-12-23 22:31:12,"Most people wouldn't think to make their own vanilla extract, primarily because it's easy to buy in a store but more importantly because, when you find out it takes a year, you'll probably turn away. But if you make it right now, it'll be ready just in time for the next holiday season! And it's the easiest recipe in the history of cooking. 

Ingredients: 
2 cups vodka or bourbon
5-6 vanilla beans 
sealed glass bottle

1. Add ingredients to the bottle and seal. Let it rest at room temperature for 6-12 months. Enjoy!

Nick DiGiovanni,Homemade Butter,2020-12-20 05:41:58,"You might think of butter as something that doesn't necessarily get better homemade (i.e., easier to get some at the store and call it a day), but you'd be terribly wrong. It's three times as good made at home, and it's also one of the easiest recipes you could ever have. If you've made whipped cream, you can make butter...it just requires a few more minutes of blending. Recipe below! 

Ingredients 
2 cups heavy cream 
pinch of salt 

1. Pour cream into a food processor or blender. Process for 10 minutes, or until the butter separates.
2. Strain off the liquid and continue pressing out butter with a wooden spoon until all liquid is gone. Season, shape into a brick or roll, and enjoy.

Nick DiGiovanni,Strawberry Tanghulu,2020-12-10 23:48:31,"This is a fun, simple recipe and it creates a VERY satisfying treat. The recipe is below. Be careful not to overcook the sugar...if it starts to get too much of a caramel color, immediately remove it from the heat. And, when you go to dip whatever it is you decide to dip, make sure to do it quickly so that the sugar does not begin to harden in the pan (or heat the sugar up again a bit). 

Ingredients: 
2 cups sugar 
1 cup water 

1. Heat ingredients in a small pan and bring to a boil. DO NOT stir. 
2. Once it has been boiling for a few minutes and begins to get a bit of color, start testing if it's ready by dipping a stick into the sugar and then immediately plunging it into ice water. If it hardens immediately and cracks/is crunchy when you bite it, it's ready. 
3. Pick fruits that don't have too much water/liquid in them to dip. A whole strawberry, for example, is okay. If you were to cut it, however, it may have too much liquid to allow the sugar to adhere. 
4. Dip your fruit/other food and immediately plunge into the ice water to harden! Enjoy.
